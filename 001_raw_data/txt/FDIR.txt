of the amount required to maintain the reserve ratio at
1.5 percent of estimated insured deposits, as dividends
to be paid to insured depository institutions.
‘‘(B) RESERVE RATIO EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF 1.35
PERCENT OF ESTIMATED INSURED DEPOSITS AND NOT MORE
THAN 1.5 PERCENT.—If, at the end of a calendar year, the

reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund equals or
exceeds 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits and
is not more than 1.5 percent of such deposits, the Corporation shall declare the amount in the Fund that is equal
to 50 percent of the amount in excess of the amount
required to maintain the reserve ratio at 1.35 percent of
the estimated insured deposits as dividends to be paid

Corporation shall prescribe by regulation, after notice and
opportunity for comment, the method for the calculation,

Board determines in writing that—
‘‘(i) a significant risk of losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund exists over the next 1-year period; and
‘‘(ii) it is likely that such losses will be sufficiently
high as to justify a finding by the Board that the
reserve ratio should temporarily be allowed—

subparagraph (B); or
‘‘(II) to exceed the maximum amount established under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i).
‘‘(F) CONSIDERATIONS.—In making a determination
under subparagraph (E), the Board shall consider—

impact on insured depository institutions;

institutions or a specific group or type of depository
institution;

institutions adequately addresses concerns over
funding levels in the Deposit Insurance Fund; and
‘‘(iv) any other factors that the Board determines
are appropriate.
‘‘(G) REVIEW OF DETERMINATION.—
‘‘(i) ANNUAL REVIEW.—A determination to suspend
or limit dividends under subparagraph (E) shall be
reviewed by the Board of Directors annually.
‘‘(ii) ACTION BY BOARD.—Based on each annual
review under clause (i), the Board of Directors shall
either renew or remove a determination to suspend
or limit dividends under subparagraph (E), or shall
make a new determination in accordance with this
paragraph. Unless justified under the terms of the
renewal or new determination, the Corporation shall

(ii) by adding at the end the following new clauses:
‘‘(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘qualified
State long-term care insurance partnership’ means an approved
State plan amendment under this title that provides for the
disregard of any assets or resources in an amount equal to
the insurance benefit payments that are made to or on behalf
of an individual who is a beneficiary under a long-term care
insurance policy if the following requirements are met:
‘‘(I) The policy covers an insured who was a resident
of such State when coverage first became effective under

‘‘(bb) has attained age 61 but has not attained
age 76 as of such date, the policy provides some level
of inflation protection; and

public and private coverage of long-term care.
‘‘(VI) The issuer of the policy provides regular reports
to the Secretary, in accordance with regulations of the
Secretary, that include notification regarding when benefits
provided under the policy have been paid and the amount
of such benefits paid, notification regarding when the policy
otherwise terminates, and such other information as the
Secretary determines may be appropriate to the administration of such partnerships.

affecting the terms or benefits of such a policy unless
the State imposes such requirement on long-term care
insurance policies without regard to whether the policy
is covered under the partnership or is offered in connection

In the case of a long-term care insurance policy which is
exchanged for another such policy, subclause (I) shall be applied

protection standards which applied under such State plan
amendment as of December 31, 2005.

‘‘(B) as affecting the authority of the Secretary through

the provision of medical assistance for an individual upon
prepayment of a premium authorized to be imposed under
this section, or may terminate eligibility for such medical assistance on the basis of failure to pay such a premium but shall
not terminate eligibility of an individual for medical assistance
under this title on the basis of failure to pay any such premium
until such failure continues for a period of not less than 60
days. A State may apply the previous sentence for some or
all groups of beneficiaries as specified by the State and may
waive payment of any such premium in any case where the
State determines that requiring such payment would create
an undue hardship.

entitled to medical assistance under this title for such care,
items, or services, the payment of any cost sharing authorized
to be imposed under this section with respect to such care,
items, or services. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed

(2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:

cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria
that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration
program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended

that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration
programs.
‘‘(B) GAO REPORT.—
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 3 months after

of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.
‘‘(4) NO REQUIREMENT FOR STATEWIDENESS.—Nothing in

regard to the annual deductible.
‘‘(2) ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE.—The amount of the annual
deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100
