2013.
(6) 1BaFin may require an institution or a superordinated undertaking to furnish the
necessary proof of compliance with the conditions even after exemption has been granted
pursuant to subsections (1) to (4) or where exemption remains valid pursuant to subsection
(5). 2It may also require an institution or a superordinated undertaking to put in place
arrangements which are appropriate and necessary to remedy existing deficiencies and may
set a suitable deadline for compliance. 3If the institution fails to furnish proof or does not do
so within the prescribed period or fails to remedy deficiencies or does not do so within the
prescribed period, BaFin may revoke the exemption or require the institution to reapply the
provisions to which the exemption related.

shall be excluded when calculating the institution's own funds. 2Where such an institution is
operated in the legal form of a commercial sole proprietorship, the proprietor shall put in
place appropriate arrangements to protect his/her customers in the event that the institution
discontinues its business operations owing to the proprietor’s death or legal incapacity or for
other reasons.

Section 2c
Holders of significant holdings
(1) 1Anyone who intends to acquire a significant holding in an institution, either alone or in
concert with other persons or undertakings (proposed acquirer), shall report this intention in
writing to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank without delay in accordance with sentence 2.
2
In this report, the proposed acquirer shall give the relevant information and documentation,
which are to be specified in more detail by way of a statutory order pursuant to section 24
(4), germane to the amount of the holding and to the establishment of the significant
influence, as well as to the assessment of his/her trustworthiness and examination of the
further grounds for prohibition pursuant to subsection (1b) sentence 1, and name the
individuals or undertakings from whom or which he/she intends to acquire the corresponding
capital shares. 3The statutory order may provide, in particular also in individual case
decisions or as a general rule, that the proposed acquirer shall present the documentation
specified in section 32 (1) sentence 2 number 6 letters (d) and (e). 4Where the proposed
acquirer is a legal person or a commercial partnership, the report shall contain the relevant
information germane to assessing the trustworthiness of its legal representatives or
representatives pursuant to the articles of association or articles of incorporation, or of its
general partners. 5The holder of a significant holding shall report without delay every newly
appointed legal representative or representative pursuant to the articles of association or
articles of incorporation, or new general partner to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank in
writing, together with the relevant information germane to assessing his/her trustworthiness.
6
The holder of a significant holding shall, moreover, notify BaFin and the Deutsche
Bundesbank in writing without delay if he/she intends, either alone or in concert with other
persons or undertakings, to increase the amount of the significant holding in such a way that
the thresholds of 20%, 30% or 50% of the voting rights or capital are reached or exceeded,
or that the institution comes under his/her control. 7BaFin shall provide the party required to
submit the report with written acknowledgement of receipt of a complete report pursuant to
sentence 1 or sentence 6 without delay, at the latest however within two working days of
receipt thereof.
(1a) 1BaFin shall assess the report pursuant to subsection (1) within 60 working days of the
date on its letter acknowledging receipt of a complete report (assessment period). 2In the
acknowledgement provided pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 7, BaFin shall inform the
party required to submit the report of the date on which the assessment period will end.
3
BaFin may make a written request for further information which it requires to complete the
assessment no later than on the 50th working day of the assessment period. 4The request
shall be made in writing, specifying the additional information required. 5BaFin shall provide
the party required to submit the report with written acknowledgement of receipt of this
additional information without delay, at the latest however within two working days of receipt
thereof. 6The assessment period shall be suspended from the time when the request for
further information is made until BaFin receives this information. 7In the event of a
suspension pursuant to sentence 6, the assessment period shall not exceed 80 working
days. 8BaFin may request completion or clarification of the information; this shall not result in
a further suspension of the assessment period. 9Notwithstanding sentence 7, the
23

Section 2c

assessment period may be extended to up to 90 working days in the event of a suspension if
the party required to submit the report
1

is situated or supervised in a non-EEA state, or

2

is a natural person or undertaking not subject to supervision under Directive
2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the
coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to
undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (OJ L 302/32
of 17 November 2009), Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the
coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct
insurance other than life assurance, Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 5 November 2002 concerning life assurance, Directive
2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on
markets in financial instruments, Directive 2005/68/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 16 November 2002 on reinsurance, or Directive 2013/36/EU.

(1b) 1BaFin may oppose the proposed acquisition of or increase in the significant holding
within the assessment period if facts are known which warrant the assumption that
1

the party required to submit the report or, if it is a legal person, a legal representative
or representative pursuant to the articles of association or articles of incorporation, or,
if it is a commercial partnership, a partner, is not trustworthy or for any other reason
does not satisfy the requirements to be set in the interests of the sound and prudent
management of the institution; in case of doubt, this shall also apply if facts are known
which warrant the assumption that the funds raised in order to acquire the significant
holding were secured by means of an action which objectively constitutes a criminal
offence;

2

the institution will not be able to comply and continue to comply with the prudential
requirements based, in particular, on Directive 2013/36/EU, Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 as last amended, Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 16 September 2009 on the taking up, pursuit and prudential
supervision of the business of electronic money institutions amending Directives
2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC, Directive
2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on
payment services in the internal market amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC,
2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC, Directive 2002/87/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the
supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and
investment firms in a financial conglomerate and Directive 2006/49/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of
investment firms and credit institutions, or the institution, through acquiring or
increasing the significant holding would be integrated into a corporate network with
the holder of the significant holding which, owing to the structure of cross24

Section 2c

shareholdings or because of inadequate economic transparency, would hamper the
effective supervision of the institution or the effective exchange of information among
the competent authorities or the allocation of responsibilities among the said
authorities;
3

the acquisition of or increase in the significant holding would make the institution a
subsidiary of an institution domiciled in a non-EEA state that is not effectively
supervised in the state where it is domiciled or has its head office or whose
competent supervisory body is not prepared to cooperate satisfactorily with BaFin;

4

the future senior manager is not trustworthy or does not have the necessary
professional knowledge, skills and experience;

5

in connection with the proposed acquisition of or increase in the holding, money
laundering or terrorist financing within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive
2005/60/EC is being or has been committed or attempted, or the acquisition of or
increase in the holding could aggravate the risk of such occurring, or

6

the party required to submit the report does not have the requisite financial
soundness; this is especially the case if, owing to its capital adequacy or asset
situation, the party required to submit the report is unable to fulfil the special
requirements laid down by law with regard to an institution’s own funds and liquidity.

2

BaFin may also oppose the acquisition of or increase in the holding if the information
pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 or sentence 6 or the additional information required
pursuant to subsection (1a) sentence 3 is incomplete or incorrect or does not meet the
requirements laid down in the statutory order pursuant to section 24 (4). 3BaFin may neither
impose prior conditions in respect of the size of the holding to be acquired or the intended
increase in the holding nor examine the proposed acquisition in terms of the economic needs
of the market. 4If, after completing its assessment, BaFin decides to oppose the acquisition of
or increase in the holding, it shall inform the party required to submit the report of its decision
in writing within two working days and in observance of the assessment period, stating the
reasons therefor. 5Any comments and reservations on the part of the competent authorities
responsible for the party required to submit the report shall be cited in the decision;
opposition is permissible only for the reasons given in sentences 1 and 2. 6If the acquisition
of or increase in the holding is not opposed in writing within the assessment period, then the
acquisition or increase may be executed; this is without prejudice to BaFin’s rights pursuant
to subsection (2). 7BaFin may set a deadline after which the party required to submit the
report shall provide notification of whether or not the proposed acquisition of or increase in
the holding has been executed. 8Upon expiry of this deadline, the party required to submit
the report shall notify BaFin without delay.
(2) 1BaFin may prohibit the holder of a significant holding as well as the undertakings that it
controls from exercising the voting rights and order that the capital shares may be used only
with BaFin’s consent if

25

Section 2c

1

the prerequisites for a prohibition order pursuant to subsection (1b) sentence 1 or
sentence 2 exist,

2

the holder of the significant holding has not fulfilled its duty pursuant to subsection (1)
to give BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank prior notification of its intention and has
not made such notification subsequently by a deadline set by BaFin, or

3

the holding has been acquired or increased contrary to an enforceable prohibition
pursuant to subsection (1b) sentence 1 or sentence 2.

2

In the event of a prohibition pursuant to sentence 1, the court having jurisdiction at the
institution’s domicile – at the request of BaFin, the institution or a holder of an interest in the
institution – shall appoint a trustee to whom it shall transfer the exercise of voting rights. 3In
exercising the voting rights, the trustee shall take due account of the interests of a sound and
prudent management of the institution. 4Over and above the measures pursuant to sentence
1, BaFin may commission the trustee to sell the capital shares insofar as they establish a
significant holding if the holder of the significant holding does not provide BaFin with proof of
a trustworthy buyer by an appropriate deadline set by BaFin; the holders of the capital shares
shall cooperate in the sale to the extent necessary. 5If the prerequisites specified in sentence
1 no longer exist, BaFin shall apply for the appointment of the trustee to be revoked. 6The
trustee shall be entitled to the reimbursement of reasonable expenses and remuneration for
his/her activities. 7The court shall determine such expenses and remuneration at the trustee’s
request; an appeal on a point of law against the fixing of remuneration by the court shall not
be permissible. 8The institution and the relevant holder of the significant holding shall be
jointly and severally liable for the costs arising from the appointment of the trustee, the
expenses that he/she is to be granted and his/her remuneration. 9BaFin shall advance such
expenses and remuneration.
(3) 1Anyone who intends to dispose of a significant holding in an institution or to reduce the
amount of his/her significant holding below the thresholds of 20%, 30% or 50% of the voting
rights or the capital held, or to change the holding in such a way that the institution ceases to
be a controlled undertaking, shall report this in writing to BaFin and the Deutsche

the intended reduction or change in the holding has been executed. 4Upon expiry of this
deadline, the person or commercial partnership who has submitted the report pursuant to
sentence 1 shall notify BaFin without delay.
(4) 1BaFin shall temporarily oppose or limit the acquisition of a direct or indirect holding in an
institution, through which the institution would become a subsidiary of an undertaking
domiciled in a non-EEA state, if a decision to this effect has been taken by the European
Commission pursuant to Article 147 (2) of Directive 2013/36/EU or Article 15 (3) sentence 2

financial holding company.
(2) Where a mixed financial holding company is subject to equivalent provisions under
Directive 2006/48/EC and Directive 2009/138/EC, in particular with regard to risk-based

(Repealed)
Section 6
Functions
(1) 1BaFin exercises supervision over institutions pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the
statutory orders enacted in connection therewith, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended and legal acts enacted on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive
2013/36/EU. 2BaFin is the competent authority for the application of Article 458 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as well as the competent authority pursuant to Article 4 (1) of Directive
2013/36/EU. 3The Deutsche Bundesbank is the competent authority pursuant to Article 4 (1)
of Directive 2013/36/EU within the scope of the functions assigned to it pursuant to section 7

Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and to the legal acts enacted on the basis thereof.
(2) BaFin shall counteract undesirable developments in the lending and financial services
sector which may endanger the safety of the assets entrusted to institutions, impair the
proper conduct of banking business or provision of financial services or entail major
disadvantages for the economy as a whole.
(3) 1BaFin may, as part of its statutory mandate, issue orders to institutions and their senior
managers that are appropriate and necessary to prevent or stop violations of regulatory
provisions or to prevent or overcome undesirable developments at an institution which could
endanger the safety of the assets entrusted to the institution or impair the proper conduct of
its banking business or provision of financial services. 2The power to issue orders pursuant to

Section 6a

Section 6a
Special functions
(1) If there is evidence indicating that deposits accepted by an institution, other assets
entrusted to an institution or a financial transaction serve or would serve, if a financial
transaction were to be executed, the purpose of preparing a serious act of violent subversion
pursuant to section 89a (1) and (2) number 4 of the German Criminal Code or financing a
terrorist group pursuant to section 129a also in conjunction with section 129b of the Criminal
Code, then BaFin may
1

issue instructions to the institution's management;

2

prohibit the institution from allowing funds to be withdrawn or transferred from an
account or safe custody account held with it;

3

prohibit an institution from carrying out other financial transactions.

(2) Indications shall notably be construed as evidence within the meaning of subsection (1)
where the holder of an account or a safe custody account, the persons authorised to draw on
the said account or an institution's customer is a natural or legal person or an association of
persons without legal personality whose name is on the list of the European Council adopted
in connection with combating terrorism as part of the Council Common Position
2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat
terrorism (OJ EC L 344/93) as last amended.
(3) In individual cases BaFin may release assets that are subject to an order issued pursuant
to subsection (1) at the request of the natural or legal person concerned or of an association
of persons without legal personality insofar as these assets serve to cover the minimum
subsistence costs of the person or its family members or to pay pension benefits,
maintenance payments or similar purposes.
(4) An order issued pursuant to subsection (1) shall be repealed as soon and insofar as the
reason for issuing it no longer exists.
(5) The institution or any other aggrieved party may object to an order issued pursuant to
subsection (1).
(6) This is without prejudice to the right to order restrictions on capital movements and
payments pursuant to section 4 (1) of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act
(Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz).
Section 6b
Supervisory review and evaluation
(1) 1As part of its prudential supervisory tasks, BaFin reviews the arrangements, strategies,
processes and mechanisms implemented by an institution to comply with the prudential
requirements, and evaluates

32

Section 6b

1

the risks to which the institution is or might be exposed, notably including the risks
revealed by stress testing taking into account the nature, scope and complexity of an
institution's activities, and

2

the risks that an institution poses to the financial system taking into account the
identification and measurement of systemic risk under Article 23 of Regulation (EU)
No 1093/2010 and recommendations of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB),
where appropriate.

2

To this end it cooperates with the Deutsche Bundesbank pursuant to section 7.

(2) 1On the basis of the review and evaluation, BaFin makes a summary and forward-looking
assessment of whether the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms
implemented by an institution and the liquidity and own funds held by it ensure appropriate
and effective risk management and sound coverage of its risks. 2In addition to credit, market
and operational risk, BaFin takes particular account of
1

the results of internal stress tests carried out by an institution which adopts an internal
ratings-based (IRB) approach or which uses an internal model to calculate its own
funds requirements for market risk as set out in Articles 362 to 377 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 as last amended;

2

an institution's ability in the light of valuation adjustments taken pursuant to Article
105 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended to sell or hedge out its trading
book positions within a short period without incurring material losses under normal
market conditions;

3

the exposure to and management of concentration risk by an institution, including its
compliance with the prudential requirements;

4

the impact of diversification effects and how such effects are factored into an
institution's risk measurement system;

5

the robustness, suitability and manner of application of the policies and procedures
implemented by an institution for the management of the residual risk associated with
the use of recognised credit risk mitigation techniques;

6

the adequacy of the own funds held by an institution for securitisations for which the
institution is the originator, taking into account the economic substance of the
transaction and the degree of risk transfer achieved; in this context, BaFin monitors
whether an institution provides implicit support to a transaction;

7

the exposure to, evaluation of and management of liquidity risk by an institution,
including the development of alternative scenario analyses and effective contingency
plans, as well as the management of risk mitigants, in particular the level, composition
and quality of liquidity buffers;

8

the results of prudential stress tests pursuant to subsection (3) or Article 32 of
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010;

9

the geographical location of an institution's exposures;
33

Section 7

10

the business model;

11

an institution's interest rate risk arising from non-trading activities;

12

the processes and mechanisms for determining and ensuring an institution's internal
capital adequacy pursuant to section 25a;

13

the exposure of an institution to the risk of excessive leverage as reflected by
indicators of excessive leverage, including the leverage ratio determined in
accordance with Article 429 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended; in
determining the adequacy of the leverage ratio of an institution and of the
arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by the institution
to manage the risk of excessive leverage, BaFin takes account of the institution's
business model;

14

an institution's arrangements for ensuring sound management, the nature of their
implementation and practical execution as well as the ability of the members of the
management body to perform their duties;

15

an institution's systemic risk assessed pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 number
2.

(3) 1BaFin may subject an institution to supervisory stress tests or commission the Deutsche
Bundesbank to carry out such stress tests. 2To this end, BaFin or the Deutsche Bundesbank
may
1

require the institution to calculate its risk, own funds and liquidity positions using the
institution's own risk management methods in prudentially defined scenarios and
transmit the data and results to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank, and

2

determine the impact of shocks on the institution on the basis of supervisory stress
testing methods using the available data.

(4) 1In consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, BaFin establishes the frequency and
intensity of the reviews, evaluations and possible supervisory stress tests having regard to
the size, systemic importance and the nature, scale and complexity of an institution's
activities. 2The reviews and evaluations shall be updated at least annually.
Section 7
Cooperation with the Deutsche Bundesbank
(1) 1BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank will cooperate as stipulated in this Act. 2Without
prejudice to further legal provisions, this cooperation encompasses the ongoing supervision
of institutions by the Deutsche Bundesbank. 3Ongoing supervision notably entails evaluating
the documentation submitted by institutions, audit reports pursuant to section 26 and annual
financial statements as well as performing and evaluating on-site inspections with a view to
assessing institutions' capital adequacy and risk management procedures, as well as
appraising inspection findings. 4As a rule, the Deutsche Bundesbank’s ongoing supervision is
performed by its Regional Offices (Hauptverwaltungen).
34

Section 7
(2) 1In this context, the Deutsche Bundesbank shall observe the guidelines issued by BaFin.
2
BaFin’s guidelines on ongoing supervision shall be issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 3If agreement cannot be reached within an appropriate period of time, the
Federal Ministry of Finance will issue such guidelines in consultation with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 4BaFin is responsible for the regulatory measures that apply to institutions, in
particular general decrees and administrative decisions, including ordering inspections
pursuant to section 44 (1) sentence 2 and section 44b (2) sentence 1. 5As a rule, BaFin
bases its regulatory measures on the Deutsche Bundesbank's inspection findings and
appraisals.
(3) 1BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank shall exchange observations and findings that are
necessary for the performance of their respective functions. 2In this regard, the Deutsche
Bundesbank shall also communicate to BaFin the data that it obtains by virtue of collecting
statistics pursuant to section 18 of the Bundesbank Act (Gesetz über die Deutsche
Bundesbank). 3It shall consult BaFin prior to ordering such collection of statistics; section 18
sentence 5 of the Bundesbank Act applies mutatis mutandis.
(4) 1The cooperation pursuant to subsection (1) and the communication pursuant to
subsection (3) include the transmission of personal data needed by the recipient for the
performance of its functions. 2In order to perform their functions under this Act, BaFin and the
Deutsche Bundesbank are permitted to access the data stored in each other’s databases via
automated means. 3Every tenth time that BaFin retrieves personal data from the Deutsche
Bundesbank's database, the Deutsche Bundesbank shall log the time, the details identifying
the data records retrieved as well as the identity of the retriever. 4The logged data shall be
used solely for the purpose of safeguarding data protection or data security or for ensuring
the proper functioning of the data processing system. 5They shall be deleted at the end of the
calendar year following that in which the data are logged, unless they are needed for an
ongoing monitoring procedure. 6Sentences 3 to 5 apply mutatis mutandis to data retrievals by
the Deutsche Bundesbank from BaFin’s database. 7This is otherwise without prejudice to the
provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz).
(5) 1BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank may set up joint data files. 2Each party may alter,
block or delete only those data that it itself has entered and is deemed to be the competent
authority within the meaning of the Federal Data Protection Act only with regard to the data
which it itself has entered. 3If either party has grounds to suspect that the data entered by the
other party are incorrect, it shall notify the other party thereof without delay. 4The other party
shall verify the accuracy of the data without delay and, if necessary, correct, block or delete
the data without delay. 5When a joint data file is set up, it shall be determined which party is
to take the technical and organisational measures pursuant to section 9 of the Federal Data
Protection Act. 6The party designated pursuant to sentence 5 shall ensure that members of
staff are granted access to personal data only to the extent necessary for performing their
functions. 7Retrievals of personal data by the party which did not enter the data shall be
logged in the manner described in subsection (4) sentences 3 to 5.

pursuant to section 10d, the ratio's calculation basis in accordance with the statutory order
pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1 number 5 and its application period, and will inform the
ESRB of the fact that BaFin takes into account variables within the meaning of the statutory

(2) If tax evasion proceedings are initiated against proprietors or senior managers of
institutions or against holders of significant holdings in institutions or their legal or statutory
representatives or general partners or against persons who actually manage the business of
a financial holding company or a mixed financial holding company, or if such proceedings are
averted by the submission of a corrective declaration amending a previously false
submission (Selbstanzeige) pursuant to section 371 of the German Tax Code
(Abgabenordnung), section 30 of the Tax Code shall not bar notifying BaFin of the
proceedings and the underlying information; the same applies if the proceedings are initiated
against persons who committed the offence whilst in the employ of an institution or a holder
of a significant holding in an institution.
(3) 1BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank – insofar as it is acting under this Act – will
cooperate with the competent EEA authorities and with EBA and ESMA in the supervision of
institutions which conduct banking business or provide financial services in another EEA
state as well as in the supervision of groups of institutions, financial holding groups or mixed
financial holding groups within the meaning of section 10a (1) to (5). 2For the assessment
pursuant to section 2c (1a) and (1b), BaFin will cooperate with the competent EEA
authorities if the party required to report is

39

Section 8

1

a CRR institution, a primary insurance or reinsurance undertaking or a management
company within the meaning of Article 2 (1) letter (b) of Directive 2009/65/EC (UCITS
management company) which is authorised in a different member state or a different
sector than the one in which the acquisition is intended;

2

a parent undertaking of a CRR institution, primary insurance or reinsurance
undertaking or UCITS management company which is authorised in a different
member state or a different sector than the one in which the acquisition is intended, or

3

a natural or legal person that controls a CRR institution, primary insurance or
reinsurance undertaking or a UCITS management company which is authorised in a
different member state or a different sector than the one in which the acquisition is
intended.

3

Subject to section 4b (1) in conjunction with section 15 (1) of the Federal Data Protection
Act, they will exchange with them all relevant and fundamental information required for the
exercise of supervision. 4Fundamental information may also be forwarded without a
corresponding request from the competent agency. 5In this respect, fundamental information
shall be deemed to comprise all information which may affect the assessment of an
institution’s financial situation in the EEA state in question. 6This shall notably include
1

disclosure of the group's legal and organisational structure as well as the
arrangements for ensuring sound management of the group, including all the group's
supervised undertakings, non-supervised undertakings, non-supervised subsidiaries
and significant branches, and identification of the relevant competent authorities,

2

procedures for collecting and reviewing information from group institutions,

3

any adverse developments at institutions or at other group entities which could
seriously impair the institutions, and

4

any severe or exceptional supervisory measures which BaFin has taken under this
Act or under the statutory orders issued with regard to this Act’s enforcement.

7

BaFin will transmit to the competent authority in the host member state
1. all information necessary for assessing the trustworthiness and professional
qualifications of the persons named in section 1 (2) sentence 1;
2. all information necessary to assess the trustworthiness of the holders of a significant
holding in undertakings in the same group having their head office in Germany which is
required for the granting of an authorisation to and the ongoing supervision of an
undertaking within the meaning of section 33b sentence 1 that intends to conduct
banking business pursuant to section 1 (1) sentence 2 numbers 1, 2, 4 and 10 or
provide financial services pursuant to section 1 (1a) sentence 2 numbers 1 to 4 in the
host member state;
3. without delay information and findings obtained in monitoring the institution's liquidity
that is necessary for supervising the branch in the light of depositor and investor
protection or the financial stability of the host member state, and
40

Section 8

4. information on liquidity difficulties that are occurring or are highly likely, and details on
the preparation and implementation of a recovery plan and on all prudential measures
taken in this context.
8

Information pursuant to sentence 6 numbers 3 and 4 shall also be communicated to the
competent authority in the host member state in which a CRR credit institution has branches
that are classified as significant. 9If a competent authority in another EEA state fails to
transmit necessary information, BaFin may request assistance from EBA pursuant to Article
19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 10BaFin may also request assistance from EBA or
ESMA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and Regulation (EU)
1095/2010 if a request for cooperation, in particular for the exchange of information, has
been refused by a competent authority or has not been acted upon within a reasonable time.
(3a) 1The competent authority within the meaning of subsection (3) sentence 1 may ask for
BaFin’s cooperation in a monitoring operation, an inspection or an investigation. 2In the case
of requests within the meaning of sentence 1, BaFin will make use of all the powers vested in
it according to law with a view to monitoring compliance with this Act and corresponding
provisions of these states insofar as this is appropriate and necessary to meet the requests.
3
BaFin may refuse to perform an investigation, transmit information or allow staff of these
foreign authorities to participate in such inspections if
1

this might impair the sovereignty, security or public order of the Federal Republic of
Germany, or

2

judicial proceedings have already been initiated or an unappealable decision has
already been rendered with respect to the same matter against the same persons.

4

If BaFin fails to comply with such a request or makes use of its right pursuant to sentence 1,
it will notify the requesting authority without delay, explaining the reasons therefor; in the
case of a refusal pursuant to sentence 3 number 2, it shall transmit precise information about
the judicial proceedings or unappealable decision.
(4) 1In cases where BaFin is responsible for supervising EU parent institutions or institutions
which are controlled by an EU parent financial holding company or a EU parent mixed
financial holding company, it shall, upon request, transmit all relevant information to the
competent authorities in the other EEA states responsible for supervising subsidiaries of
these institutions. 2Relevant information in this context means all information that may
materially influence the assessment of an institution’s financial soundness in another EEA
state. 3The scope of this notification requirement depends, in particular, on the subsidiary’s
systemic importance for the state in question.
(5) Notifications from the competent authorities of another state may be used only for the
following purposes:
1

to verify an institution's authorisation to conduct business,

2

to monitor the institutions’ activities on an individual or a consolidated basis,
41

Section 8

3

for orders issued by BaFin and for the prosecution and punishment of breaches of
administrative regulations by BaFin,

4

in the context of administrative proceedings regarding legal remedies against a
decision by BaFin, or

5

in the context of proceedings before administrative courts, insolvency courts, public
prosecutors or courts having jurisdiction in criminal cases or administrative fine cases.

(6) 1Before making a decision on the following matters, BaFin will routinely consult the
competent EEA authorities to the extent that the decision is of relevance for their supervisory
activities:
1

changes in the structure of the holders, organisation or management of group
institutions which require BaFin’s consent,

2

severe or exceptional banking supervisory measures. In such cases, at least the
authority responsible for supervision on a consolidated basis shall always be
consulted, unless BaFin is the competent supervisor in this respect.

2

BaFin may waive prior consultation of the competent authorities in the event of imminent
danger. 3The same applies if prior consultation might compromise the measure's
effectiveness; in such cases, BaFin will inform the competent authorities without delay after it
has adopted or implemented the measure.
(7) 1Where BaFin is responsible for supervising a group of institutions, a financial holding
group or a mixed financial holding group on a consolidated basis and an emergency situation
arises, particularly adverse developments on the financial markets, that poses a threat to the
market liquidity and stability of the financial system of an EEA state in which one of the group
entities has its head office or a branch has been classified as significant, BaFin shall without
delay inform the Federal Ministry of Finance, EBA, the ESRB, the Deutsche Bundesbank and
the central governments of the other member states, insofar as they are affected, and
communicate to them all essential information to enable them to perform their functions. 2If
BaFin becomes aware of an emergency situation within the meaning of sentence 1 in any
other cases, it shall without delay inform the competent authorities responsible for
supervision on a consolidated basis of the affected groups of institutions, financial holding
groups or mixed financial holding groups, as well as EBA. 3This is without prejudice to
section 9.
(8) BaFin will notify the competent authorities of the host member state of any measures
which it will take to end an institution’s breaches of the host member state’s legal provisions
of which BaFin has been informed by the competent authorities of the host member state.
(9) 1If BaFin has sufficient indications that the provisions of this Act, Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 or corresponding provisions of the EEA states have been breached, it will inform
the authority responsible for cooperation in the supervision of institutions within whose
jurisdiction the breach has occurred. 2If BaFin receives a corresponding notification from

42

Section 8a

competent authorities of other states, it will inform these authorities of the outcome of any
inquiries which it initiates in this regard.
Section 8a
Special functions with regard to supervision on a consolidated basis
(1) Where BaFin is responsible for the consolidated supervision of a group of institutions, a
financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group within the meaning of section 10a
which is headed by an EU parent institution, an EU parent financial holding company or an
EU parent mixed financial holding company, it will be responsible not only for the functions
ensuing from this Act, but also for the following functions:
1

coordinating the collection and dissemination of relevant and essential information
pursuant to section 8 (3) in the context of ongoing supervision as well as in
emergency situations; this includes the collection and disclosure of information about
the legal and organisational structure as well as the collection and disclosure of
information regarding the arrangements for ensuring sound management;

2

planning and coordinating supervisory activities in the context of ongoing supervision
as well as in emergency situations, particularly in the event of adverse developments
at institutions or on the financial markets; BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank –
insofar as it is acting under this Act – will cooperate as appropriate with the respective
competent authorities of the other EEA states; in the context of ongoing supervision,
such cooperation encompasses, in particular, the ongoing monitoring of institutions’
risk management, cross-border inspections, measures in the event of organisational
deficiencies pursuant to section 45b, disclosure by the institutions and the technical
criteria concerning the organisation and treatment of risks laid down in Articles 76 to
87 and 92 to 96 of Directive 2013/36/EU; in emergency situations, particularly in the
event of adverse developments at institutions or on the financial markets, cooperation
will include the ordering of measures pursuant to sections 45 to 46b, the preparation
of joint assessments, the implementation of contingency plans and communication to
the public;

3

transmitting lists within the meaning of section 7a (3) to the respective competent
authorities of the other EEA states.

2

If the competent authorities of the other EEA states do not cooperate with BaFin to the
extent necessary for it to perform its tasks pursuant to sentence 1, BaFin may request
assistance from EBA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
(2) 1BaFin and the competent EEA authorities may lay down detailed provisions in
cooperation agreements for supervising groups of institutions, financial holding groups or
mixed financial holding groups within the meaning of section 10a. 2These agreements may
assign additional tasks to the relevant competent authority responsible for supervision on a
consolidated basis and specify procedures for decision-making and cooperation with other
competent authorities.

43

Section 8a
(3) 1Where BaFin is responsible for the consolidated supervision of a group of institutions, a
financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group which is headed by an EU parent
institution, an EU parent financial holding company or an EU parent mixed financial holding
company, it shall take a joint decision with the EEA authorities responsible for supervising
the group entities as to, first, whether the capital adequacy of the group on a consolidated
basis is commensurate with its financial situation and risk profile and, second, what
additional capital requirements are necessary for each group entity and on a consolidated
basis. 2The decision shall be set out in documents containing full reasons and shall duly
consider the risk assessment of subsidiaries performed by the relevant competent
authorities. 3BaFin will communicate the decision to the superordinated group entity. 4If not
all of the EEA authorities responsible for supervising the group entities agree with BaFin’s
decision, BaFin will consult EBA either on its own initiative or at the request of any one of the
other competent EEA authorities. 5EBA's opinion shall be taken into due account in the
subsequent deliberations; the decision shall justify any substantial deviations from the
opinion.
(4) 1If a joint decision is not reached within four months after a risk assessment of the group
has been submitted to the competent authorities, BaFin will decide unilaterally whether the
capital adequacy of the group of institutions, financial holding group or mixed financial
holding group on a consolidated basis and the capital adequacy of the group entities that it
supervises on either an individual or a sub-consolidated basis are commensurate with the
financial situation and risk profile or whether additional capital requirements are necessary,
and will communicate the decision to the superordinated group entity. 2BaFin will duly
consider the risk assessment of subsidiaries performed by the relevant competent
authorities. 3If, before the four-month period specified in sentence 1 expires, BaFin or a
competent authority in another EEA state requests assistance from EBA pursuant to Article
19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, BaFin will defer its decision pursuant to sentence 1 and
await any decision that EBA may make pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation (EU) No
1093/2010, and will then take its decision in conformity with the decision of EBA. 4No
requests to EBA for assistance shall be permissible after the four-month period has expired
or after a joint decision has been reached. 5BaFin will communicate to the relevant
competent authority its view regarding the capital adequacy of, and any need for additional
capital requirements for, those group entities that it does not supervise on an individual or a
sub-consolidated basis. 6If BaFin receives from another competent authority a decision
containing well documented reasons which duly considers the risk assessments performed
and the views expressed by the other competent authorities within the four-month period, it
will transmit this document to all the relevant competent authorities and to the superordinated
group entity.
(5) 1Decisions pursuant to subsections (3) and (4) shall generally be updated annually and, in
exceptional cases, more frequently if an authority responsible for supervising a group entity
requests BaFin to do so in a document containing full reasons. 2In this case, the update may
be agreed exclusively between BaFin and the competent authority that has submitted the
application.

44

Section 8b
(6) 1Where BaFin is responsible within the meaning of subsection (3) sentence 1 for
supervising a group of institutions, a financial holding group or a mixed financial holding
group, it shall seek to reach a joint decision within the meaning of subsection (3) on
measures it intends to take within the scope of liquidity supervision and on institution-specific
liquidity requirements; subsection (3) sentences 2 and 3 applies mutatis mutandis. 2If a joint
decision is not reached within one month after the assessment of the group's liquidity risk
profile has been submitted to the competent authorities, BaFin will decide on the measures
unilaterally and will communicate the decision to the superordinated group entity. 3If, before
the one-month period specified in sentence 1 expires, BaFin or a competent authority in
another EEA state requests assistance from EBA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU)
No 1093/2010, BaFin will defer its decision pursuant to sentence 1 and await any decision
that EBA may take pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and will then
take its decision in conformity with the decision of EBA. 4No requests to EBA for assistance
shall be permissible after the one-month period has expired or after a joint decision has been
reached. 5Subsection (5) applies mutatis mutandis.
Section 8b
(Repealed)
Section 8c
Delegation of responsibility for supervising groups of institutions, financial holding
groups, mixed financial holding groups and institutions belonging to a group
(1) 1BaFin may opt out of supervising a group of institutions, a financial holding group or a
mixed financial holding group within the meaning of section 10a and revocably delegate
responsibility for supervision on a consolidated basis to another competent authority within
the EEA if supervision by BaFin would be inappropriate in view of the institutions concerned
and the importance of their business activities in the other state, and if,
1

in the case of groups of institutions, the superordinated group entity is a subsidiary of
a CRR institution having its head office in the other EEA state and is included there in
supervision on a consolidated basis pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or

2

in the case of financial holding groups or mixed financial holding groups, these groups
are supervised on a consolidated basis pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 by
the competent authorities of the other EEA state.

2

In these cases, BaFin will revocably exempt the superordinated entity from the provisions of
this Act relating to supervision on a consolidated basis. 3The superordinated entity shall be
consulted prior to such exemption and delegation of responsibility to another agency. 4The
European Commission and EBA shall be informed of the existence and contents of any
agreements of this kind.
(2) 1Where BaFin assumes responsibility for the consolidated supervision of a group of
institutions, a financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group by virtue of an
agreement with a competent authority within the EEA, it may designate a group institution
45

Section 8d
having its head office in Germany as the superordinated entity. 2Section 10a applies mutatis
mutandis.
(3) 1Pursuant to Article 28 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, BaFin may revocably delegate
responsibility for supervising an institution for the authorisation of which BaFin is responsible
to another competent authority within the EEA if the institution is a subsidiary of an institution
for which this competent authority is responsible for authorisation and supervision pursuant
to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 2This institution shall be consulted before such delegation
of responsibility. 4EBA shall be informed of the existence and contents of any agreements of
this kind.
Section 8d
(Repealed)
Section 8e
Colleges of supervisors
(1) 1BaFin will establish colleges of supervisors in cases where it is responsible for the
consolidated supervision of a group of institutions, a financial holding group or a mixed
financial holding group. 2The aim of establishing colleges of supervisors is to facilitate the
exercise of the functions referred to in section 8 (7), section 8a and the provisions of the
statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1 number 3 and to ensure adequate
cooperation with the competent authorities in the EEA, including EBA, and with the
competent authorities in non-EEA states. 3The purposes of the college of supervisors include
1

exchanging information,

2

agreeing on voluntary entrustment of tasks and voluntary delegation of responsibilities
where appropriate,

3

determining supervisory examination programmes based on the risk assessment of a
group of institutions, a financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group,

4

removing unnecessary duplication of supervisory requirements,

5

consistently applying the existing prudential requirements across all entities within a
group without prejudice to existing discretionary options and discretions, and

6

planning and coordination of supervisory activities in preparation for and during
emergency situations, taking into account the work of other forums active in this area.

(2) 1BaFin will set out in a document the establishment and functioning of each college of
supervisors in consultation with the competent authorities; section 8a (2) applies mutatis
mutandis. 2BaFin chairs the meetings of the college of supervisors and decides which
competent authorities, besides BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank, will take part in a
meeting or activities of the college of supervisors. 3Besides the authorities responsible for
supervising group subsidiaries and the competent authorities of the host member state
containing a significant branch, BaFin may also decide to allow competent authorities of non46

Section 8f

EEA states to participate in a college of supervisors provided such countries have in place
professional secrecy requirements which, in the opinion of all authorities involved in the
college, are equivalent to the provisions of Title VII Chapter I Section II of Directive
2013/36/EU.
(3) BaFin will keep all members of the college of supervisors fully informed, in advance, of
the organisation of the meetings, the main issues to be discussed and the activities to be
considered and will also keep them fully informed, in a timely manner, of the actions taken in
the meetings and the measures carried out.
(4) In its decisions to be reached pursuant to subsection (2), BaFin will take due account of
the importance for the competent authorities of the supervisory activities to be planned or
coordinated, especially the potential impact on the stability of the financial system in the
countries concerned.
(5) BaFin will inform EBA about the activities of the college of supervisors, especially in
emergency situations, and will transmit to EBA all information of particular relevance for the
purposes of converging supervisory practices at the European level. 2EBA staff may
participate in the activities of colleges of supervisors pursuant to Article 21 of Regulation
(EU) No 1093/2010, including inspections pursuant to section 44 (1) and (2) where these are
performed by BaFin jointly with at least one other competent authority.
(6) 1Where BaFin is not responsible for the consolidated supervision of a group of
institutions, financial holding group or mixed financial holding group but supervises CRR
credit institutions with significant branches in other EEA countries, it will establish a college of
supervisors in order to facilitate cooperation with the competent authorities of the host
member state pursuant to section 8 (3) as well as in emergency situations. 2Subsection (2)
sentences 1 and 2 and subsections (3) and (4) apply mutatis mutandis.
(7) BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank will cooperate in performing the functions pursuant
to subsections (1) to (6).
Section 8f
Cooperation in the supervision of significant branches
(1) 1At the request of the competent authority, BaFin will designate the branch of a CRR
institution in a host member state or an EEA state as significant, with particular regard to
whether the branch satisfies the requirements set forth in section 53b (8) sentence 4; in this
case, BaFin will transmit to the competent authority
1

information pursuant to section 8 (3) sentence 6 numbers 3 and 4 and section 11 (3),

2

the results of the risk assessments of the CRR institution, and

3

decisions regarding the first-time or further use of internal approaches and regarding
measures pursuant to section 6 (3), insofar as these affect the significant branch.

47

Section 9
2

BaFin will plan and coordinate the supervisory activities within the meaning of section 8a (1)
number 2 in cooperation with the competent authorities within the meaning of sentence 1.
(2) 1BaFin will consult the competent authorities within the meaning of subsection (1)
sentence 1 on decisions regarding the institution's liquidity recovery plan where this is
relevant for liquidity risks in connection with the currency of the host member state or of the
EEA state. 2If BaFin neglects to do this or upholds its own view, the competent authority may
request assistance from EBA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
(3) If BaFin receives information and findings from the competent authority within the
meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1, it shall duly consider this when drafting the inspection
plan; in doing so, it shall take account of the potential impact on the stability of the financial
system in the host member state or the EEA state.

public disclosure requirement as well as the medium, disclosure channel, frequency
of disclosure and the scope of the data to be communicated on a confidential basis to
the European Commission pursuant to section 26a (1) sentence 5.

2

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order, subject to the proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 3The central associations representing the institutions shall be consulted before
the statutory order is issued.
(2) 1Institutions may, for the purpose of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and of the statutory
order to be issued pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1, collect and use personal data on
their customers, on persons with whom they enter into contractual negotiations on

52

Section 10

transactions which give rise to counterparty and credit risk and on persons responsible for
the performance of a counterparty and credit risk, provided that these data
1

are verifiably material to determining and recognising counterparty and credit risk
using a scientifically recognised mathematical-statistical method,

2

are necessary for the setting-up and operation, including the development and
improvement, of internal rating systems for estimating risk parameters relating to the
credit institution's or investment firm's counterparty and credit risk and

3

do not pertain to information about nationality or to data pursuant to section 3 (9) of
the Federal Data Protection Act.

2

Business and trade secrets shall be deemed equivalent to personal data. 3Notwithstanding
sentence 1 number 1, institutions may, for the purpose of developing and improving rating
systems, also collect and use data that may be material to determining and recognising
counterparty and credit risk based on plausible economic rationale. 4In particular, data that
belong to the following categories or have been extracted from data in the following
categories may be material to determining and recognising counterparty and credit risk:
1

income, financial and employment circumstances as well as other economic
circumstances, in particular nature, scope and profitability of the business activity of
the person concerned,

2

the past payment behaviour and contract fulfilment of the person concerned,

3

enforceable claims and judicial enforcement proceedings and measures against the
person concerned,

4

insolvency proceedings relating to the assets of the person concerned where these
have been initiated or an application has been made to initiate such proceedings.

5

These data may be collected from
1

the person concerned,

2

institutions that belong to the same group of institutions,

3

external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) and credit information agencies, and

4

publicly accessible sources.

6

Institutions may also transmit personal data pursuant to sentence 1 collected from service
providers tasked with the setting-up and operation, including the development and
improvement, of rating systems to other institutions within the same group of institutions and
in a pseudo-anonymised form, provided that this is necessary for the setting-up and
operation, including the development and improvement, of internal rating systems for
estimating risk parameters relating to counterparty and credit risk.
(3) 1BaFin may issue an order requiring an institution, group of institutions, financial holding
group or mixed financial holding group to meet own funds requirements in respect of risks
53

Section 10

and risk elements not covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 which go beyond
the own funds requirements pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the statutory
order pursuant to subsection 1. 2BaFin shall order such additional own funds requirements at
least in the following cases and for the following purposes:
1

where risks or risk elements are not covered by the own funds requirements pursuant
to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the statutory order pursuant to subsection (1), or
the requirements pursuant to Article 393 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on the
identification and management of large exposures are not complied with,

2

where the internal capital adequacy of the institution, group of institutions, financial
holding group or mixed financial holding group is not assured,

3

where the review pursuant to section 6b (2) sentence 2 number 2 makes it likely that
the valuation adjustments taken by the institution are not sufficient to assure own
funds adequacy,

4

where it is likely that risk is being understated despite compliance with the
requirements under this Act, under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and under the
statutory orders pursuant to subsection (1) and to section 13 (1),

5

in order to safeguard the creation of an additional own funds buffer for adverse
economic periods,

6

in order to take due account of a particular business situation of the institution, group
of institutions, financial holding group or mixed financial holding group such as the
commencement of business operations,

7

where an institution has implicitly supported a securitisation position on more than
one occasion; to this end, BaFin may order that the significant risk transfer for all
securitisation positions for which the institution is the originator shall not be
recognised, or be recognised only partially, in the calculation of the own funds
required for the purpose of taking into account expected further occasions upon which
it provides implicit support,

8

where the own funds requirements resulting from the outcome of the stress tests for
the correlation trading portfolio pursuant to Article 377 (5) sentence 3, clause 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 materially exceed the own funds requirements for the
correlation trading portfolio pursuant to Article 377 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

9

other measures are unlikely to sufficiently improve the institution's internal
procedures, processes and methods within a suitable timeframe,

10

where the institution does not have in place a proper business organisation within the
meaning of section 25a (1).

3

Insofar as institutions which BaFin believes to have similar risk profiles might be exposed to
similar risks or pose similar risks to the financial system, BaFin may issue uniform orders for
these institutions pursuant to sentence 1. 4In the case of institutions for which colleges of

54

Section 10

supervisors have been set up pursuant to section 8e, BaFin will take account of the
respective college's assessments when deciding on an order pursuant to sentence 1.
(4) 1BaFin may also require individual institutions, groups of institutions, financial holding
groups and mixed financial holding groups or individual types or groups of institutions,
groups of institutions, financial holding groups and mixed financial holding groups to maintain
own funds in excess of the own funds requirements pursuant to Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 and to the statutory order pursuant to subsection (1) for a limited period if such
capital reinforcement is necessary
1

in order to counteract the threat of a financial market dysfunction or a danger to
financial market stability, and

2

in order to prevent substantial negative repercussions for other financial sector
undertakings and for the general confidence of depositors and other market
participants in a functioning financial system.

2

A financial market dysfunction may be impending, in particular, if extraordinary market
circumstances threaten to impair the ability of several institutions that are important to the
financial market to refinance themselves. 3In such cases BaFin may assess the adequacy of
the own funds according to criteria which deviate from Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and
from the statutory order pursuant to subsection (1) and which take account of these special
market circumstances. 4Additional own funds may be stipulated, in particular, in the context
of concerted action at the European Union level aimed at strengthening confidence in the
resilience of the European banking sector and averting a potential danger to financial market
stability in Europe. 5In determining the amount and applicable composition of the additional
own funds and the applicable deadline for complying with the higher own funds
requirements, BaFin will take account of the standards which the competent European
authorities have agreed to apply in the context of concerted action at the European Union
level. 6In this context, BaFin may require the institutions to draw up a plausible plan which
spells out what measures they will take to comply with the higher own funds requirements by
the deadline stipulated by BaFin pursuant to sentence 5. 7Insofar as the plan impinges upon
the concerns of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund within the meaning of section 1 of the
Act on the Establishment of a Financial Market Stabilisation Fund, the plan will be assessed
in agreement with the Steering Committee pursuant to section 4 (1) sentence 2 of the Act on
the Establishment of a Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (Steering Committee). 8BaFin may
demand a timely improvement of the plan submitted if it considers the stated measures and
implementation periods to be inadequate or if the institution does not adhere to them. 9In
such cases, institutions shall also consider the option of applying for stabilisation measures
pursuant to the Act on the Establishment of a Financial Market Stabilisation Fund if no
alternative measures are available. 10If BaFin, in agreement with the Steering Committee,
establishes that the plan has not been improved or has been insufficiently improved, BaFin
may appoint a special commissioner within the meaning of section 45c (1) and assign to
him/her the task pursuant to section 45c (2) number 7(a). 11In addition, BaFin may order that
withdrawals by the proprietors or shareholders, the distribution of profits and the payment of
variable remuneration components are not permitted unless and until the required higher
55

Section 10a
level of own funds is reached. 12Any conflicting resolutions on profit distribution shall be void;
no claims or entitlements may be derived from any conflicting contractual provisions.
(5) Sections 313, 314, 489, 490, 723 to 725, 727 and 728 of the Civil Code and sections 132
to 135 of the Commercial Code shall not be applicable if the purpose of a capital commitment
is the lending of own funds within the meaning of Article 72 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(6) BaFin may order an institution to submit to the Deutsche Bundesbank more frequent or
also more detailed reports on its solvency than envisaged in Articles 99 to 101 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as last amended.
(7) 1BaFin may prescribe a filter for the own funds pursuant to Article 72 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 as last amended. 2If the filter is prescribed in order to take into account capital
changes which have not yet been recognised in the balance sheet, this filter will become null
and void upon the adoption of the next annual accounts drawn up for the end of a financial
year. 3At the institution's request, BaFin shall cancel its filter insofar as the reasons for it no
longer apply.
Section 10a
Determining the own funds adequacy of groups of institutions, financial holding
groups and mixed financial holding groups; authority to issue orders
(1) 1A group of institutions, financial holding group or mixed financial holding group (group) in
each case comprises a superordinated undertaking and one or more subordinated
undertakings. 2Superordinated undertakings are CRR institutions which pursuant to Article 11
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 are required to carry out consolidation as well as institutions
which pursuant to section 1a in conjunction with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
are required to carry out consolidation. 3Subordinated undertakings are undertakings which
must be included in consolidation pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or
are voluntarily included in consolidation; institutions which qualify as CRR institutions
pursuant to section 1a are deemed to be institutions within the meaning of Article 18 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 4If a credit institution which is not a CRR credit institution is a
superordinated undertaking, entities which conduct banking business solely in the form of
deposit business pursuant to section 1 (1) sentence 2 number 1 are also deemed to be
subordinated undertakings. 5Notwithstanding sentence 2, BaFin may, at the request of the
superordinated undertaking, designate another group institution as the superordinated
undertaking; the group institution shall be consulted beforehand. 6If, in the case of crossshareholdings, no institution within the group of institutions fulfils the conditions of
sentence 2, BaFin shall designate the group's superordinated undertaking. 7In the case of a
horizontal group within the meaning of Article 18 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the
group institution established in Germany with the highest total assets is deemed to be the
superordinated undertaking. 8If the superordinated undertaking is a financial services
institution which solely provides financial services within the meaning of section 1 (1a)
sentence 2 number 9 or 10, a group of institutions within the meaning of this provision is

56

Section 10a

deemed to exist only if at least one CRR institution established in Germany is subordinated
to it as a subsidiary.
(2) 1If a financial holding company within the meaning of Article 4 (1) number 20 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or a mixed financial holding company within the meaning of
Article 4 (1) number 21 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 has several subordinated institutions
established in Germany, the institution with the highest total assets is deemed to be the
superordinated undertaking; at the superordinated institution's request, BaFin will designate
a different group institution established in Germany as the superordinated undertaking; the
group institution shall be consulted beforehand 2At the request of a financial holding
company or mixed financial holding established in Germany, and after having consulted the
regulated entity which, pursuant to Article 11 (2) or Article 12 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 or sentence 1, is deemed to be the superordinated undertaking or was
designated as such by BaFin, BaFin may designate the financial holding company or mixed
financial holding company as the superordinated undertaking insofar as the latter has
demonstrated that it has the structure and organisation needed to ensure compliance with
the group-related obligations. 3After having consulted the regulated entity which, pursuant to
Article 11 (2) or Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or sentence 1, is deemed to be
the superordinated undertaking or was designated as such by BaFin pursuant to sentence 1,
BaFin may also designate a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company
established in Germany as the superordinated undertaking without having been requested to
do so insofar as this is necessary for prudential reasons, notably reasons pertaining to the
organisation and structure of the financial holding company or mixed financial holding
company. 4The financial holding company or mixed financial holding company designated as
the superordinated undertaking pursuant to sentence 2 or sentence 3 shall perform all the
group-related obligations of a superordinated undertaking. 5If the conditions for designation
as the superordinated undertaking pursuant to sentence 2 or sentence 3 no longer exist,
notably if the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company transfers its
head office to another jurisdiction or is no longer in a position to ensure compliance with the
group-related obligations, BaFin, after having consulted the financial holding company or
mixed financial holding company, shall rescind its designation; section 35 (4) shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 6BaFin shall have all the powers over a financial holding company or
mixed financial holding company designated as the superordinated undertaking pursuant to
sentence 2 or sentence 3 and its management bodies which it has over an institution as the
superordinated undertaking and its management bodies. 7If, in the case of crossshareholdings, no institution established in Germany fulfils the condition of itself not being
subordinated to any other group institution, the institution with the highest total assets shall
normally be deemed to be the superordinated undertaking; at the request of the
superordinated undertaking BaFin will designate another group institution established in
Germany as the superordinated undertaking; the group institution shall be consulted
beforehand.
(3) 1By way of derogation from subsection (1) sentences 1 to 3, a financial holding group or
mixed financial holding group is deemed not to exist if the financial holding company within
the meaning of Article 4 (1) number 30 or 31 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or mixed
57

Section 10a

financial holding company within the meaning of Article 4 (1) number 32 or 33 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 is established in another EEA state, and
1

the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company has at least one
CRR institution established in its country of incorporation subordinated to it as a
subsidiary, or

2

the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company has at least one
CRR institution established in Germany and no CRR institution established in its
country of incorporation subordinated to it, and the total assets of the CRR institution
established in Germany are not higher than the total assets of another CRR institution
established in another EEA state that is subordinated to the financial holding
company or mixed financial holding company as a subsidiary.

2

If, in a financial holding group or mixed financial holding group, more than one financial
holding company within the meaning of Article 4 (1) number 30 or 31 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 or mixed financial holding company within the meaning of Article 4 (1)
number 32 or 33 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 incorporated both in Germany and in
another EEA state are parent undertakings and if at least one CRR institution is established
in each of these countries, a financial holding group or mixed financial holding group is
deemed not to exist if the total assets of the CRR institution established in Germany is not
higher than the total assets of another CRR institution established in another EEA state
belonging to the financial holding group or mixed financial holding group as a subsidiary.
(4) 1To calculate own funds adequacy pursuant to Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 as last amended on a consolidated basis and to limit large exposure risk
pursuant to Articles 387 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the superordinated
undertakings shall aggregate the group's own funds and the relevant risk exposures. 2The
accounting values of capital instruments pursuant to Article 26 (1) letter (a), Article 51
letter (a) and Article 62 letter (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended that are
attributable to group entities shall be deducted from the own funds to be aggregated
pursuant to sentence 1. 3In the case of participations mediated by non-group undertakings,
such accounting values shall each be deducted in proportion to the arithmetical share of the
capital. 4Where the accounting value of a participation is greater than the part to be
aggregated as own funds pursuant to sentence 1 of the subordinated undertaking's Common
Equity Tier 1 items pursuant to Article 26 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended, the superordinated undertaking shall deduct the difference from the group's
Common Equity Tier 1 capital pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended. 5Counterparty and credit risk exposures arising from legal relationships between
group undertakings shall be disregarded. 6In the case of subordinated undertakings which
are not subsidiaries, the superordinated undertaking shall aggregate its own funds and the
relevant risk exposures under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended with the own
funds and the relevant risk exposures of the subordinated undertakings, in each case in
proportion to its capital share in the subordinated undertaking. 7In other respects sentences 2
to 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis, in each case also in conjunction with the statutory order
pursuant to subsection (7).
58

Section 10a
(5) 1If the superordinated undertaking of a group of institutions is obliged to prepare group
accounts pursuant to the provisions of the Commercial Code or if, pursuant to Article 4 of
Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July
2002 on the application of international accounting standards (OJ EC L 243/1 of
11 September 2002) as last amended or pursuant to section 315a (2) of the Commercial
Code, it is obliged to apply the international accounting standards adopted pursuant to
Articles 3 and 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 when preparing the group accounts, it
shall base the determination of the aggregated own funds as well as of the aggregated risk
exposures pursuant to Articles 24 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended
on the group accounts no later than five years after the respective obligation comes into
being. 2If the superordinated undertaking of a group of institutions applies the
aforementioned international accounting standards pursuant to section 315a (3) of the
Commercial Code, sentences 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis; the coming into being of
the obligation to apply the international accounting standards shall be replaced by the firsttime application thereof. 3Subsection (4) shall not apply to the cases in sentences 1 to 3. 4In
these cases the own funds and other relevant risk exposures of undertakings which are
included in the group accounts and which are not group entities within the meaning of this
provision shall be disregarded. 5Own funds and other relevant risk exposures of undertakings
not included in the group accounts which are group entities within the meaning of this
provision shall be additionally included, whereby the procedure pursuant to subsection (4)
may be applied. 6Sentences 1 to 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis to a financial holding group
or mixed financial holding group if the financial holding company or mixed financial holding
company is obliged under the aforementioned provisions to prepare group accounts or
prepares group accounts according to the aforementioned international accounting standards
pursuant to section 315a (3) of the Commercial Code.
(6) 1A group which, pursuant to subsection (5), must base the calculation of the aggregated
own funds and the aggregated risk exposures on the group accounts may, subject to BaFin's
permission, use the procedure pursuant to subsection (4) for these purposes if the use of the
group accounts is unsuitable in a particular case. 2In this case, the group's superordinated
undertaking shall apply the procedure pursuant to subsection (4) for at least three
consecutive years.
(7) 1The Federal Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, is
authorised by way of a statutory order that does not require the consent of the Bundesrat to
issue more detailed provisions on determining the own funds adequacy of groups, in
particular with regard to
1

the use of data from the group accounts in determining the aggregated own funds
adequacy when using the procedure pursuant to subsection (5),

2

the treatment of participations valued using the equity method when using the
procedure pursuant to subsection (5).

2

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order, subject to the proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche
59

Section 10b
Bundesbank. 3The central associations of the institutions shall be consulted before the
statutory order is issued.
(8) 1The superordinated undertaking is responsible for ensuring that the group has adequate
own funds. 2However, in meeting its obligations pursuant to sentence 1, it may exert
influence on the group entities only insofar as this does not conflict with generally applicable
company law.
(9) Groups are exempt from applying the requirements on a consolidated basis pursuant to
Articles 11 to 23 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 if all the group institutions are not required
to apply Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on an individual basis unless they
were exempted pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 from applying
Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on an individual basis.
(10) In the case of sub-consolidation pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,
subsections (4) to (9) shall be applied mutatis mutandis.
Section 10b
(Repealed)
Section 10c
Capital conservation buffer
(1) 1In addition to the Common Equity Tier 1 capital required, pursuant to section 10 (3), for
compliance with the own funds requirement pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 and higher own funds required to hedge risk and risk elements not covered by
Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, an institution shall maintain a capital conservation
buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. 2It shall equal 2.5% of the total risk
exposure amount determined pursuant to Article 92 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(2) Subsection (1) shall apply mutatis mutandis to groups of institutions, financial holding
groups and mixed financial holding groups which include at least one institution which is
required to meet the requirement in subsection (1) on an individual basis as well as to
institutions within the meaning of Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
Section 10d
Countercyclical capital buffer
(1) 1In addition to maintaining the Common Equity Tier 1 capital required for complying with
1

the own funds requirement pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

2

higher own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (3) to hedge risks and risk
elements which are not covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

3

higher own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (4), and

60

Section 10d

4

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c,

an institution shall maintain an institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer consisting of
Common Equity Tier 1 capital. 2Sentence 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to groups of
institutions, financial holding groups and mixed financial holding groups which include at
least one institution which is required to meet the requirement in sentence 1 on an individual
basis as well as to institutions within the meaning of Article 22 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013.
(2) 1The institution-specific countercyclical buffer rate comprises the weighted average of the
countercyclical buffer rates that apply in Germany, in the EEA other countries and in nonEEA states as well as in the associated European and overseas countries, territories and
jurisdictions in which the institution's relevant exposures are located, in force or are
applicable pursuant to the following subsections. 2To calculate the weighted average,
institutions should apply the applicable countercyclical buffer rate to the respective quotient
of the total own funds requirements for credit risk determined in accordance with Articles 107
to 311 and 325 to 377 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in the relevant EEA state, the
relevant non-EEA state as well as in the associated European and overseas countries,
territories and jurisdictions and the total own funds requirements for credit risk for all relevant
exposures.
(3) 1The domestic countercyclical buffer rate shall be between 0% and 2.5% of the total risk
exposure amount determined pursuant to Article 92 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
2
The rate shall be set by BaFin in gradients of 0.25 percentage point and assessed at
quarterly intervals. 3BaFin will take into account deviations in the credit-to-GDP ratio from its
long-term trend and any recommendations made by the German Financial Stability
Committee. 4BaFin may, if necessary, set a rate of more than 2.5%.
(4) 1If BaFin sets the domestic countercyclical buffer rate for the first time at a value of more
than zero or if it increases the prevailing rate, it will determine the date from which the
institutions must apply the increased rate when calculating the institution-specific
countercyclical buffer. 2This date shall be not more than twelve months after the publication
date of the initial definition or increase in the domestic countercyclical buffer rate. 3If the date
stipulated in sentence 1 and the publication date of the domestic countercyclical buffer rate
are less than twelve months apart, this shorter time period must be justified by exceptional
circumstances, such as a material increase in risk on account of excessive credit growth or a
situation in which the profitability of institutions in the EEA allows the domestic
countercyclical buffer rate to be increased at a faster pace.
(5) 1If BaFin reduces the existing domestic countercyclical buffer rate, it will simultaneously
state a time period during which an increase in the domestic countercyclical buffer rate is
unlikely to be expected. 2BaFin may resume the procedure at any time, also before expiry of
the announced time period, and redefine or increase the domestic countercyclical buffer rate.
3
BaFin will publish the domestic countercyclical buffer rate defined for each quarter as well
as the information set out under subsections (3) and (4) on its website.

61

Section 10e
(6) 1BaFin may recognise the countercyclical buffer defined by a another EEA state or a nonEEA state for the calculation of the institution-specific countercyclical buffer by the institutions
authorised in Germany if the rate exceeds 2.5% of the total risk exposure amount stated in
Article 92 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 2As long as BaFin has not recognised the
higher rate, the institutions authorised in Germany must apply a rate of 2.5% to the
exposures located in that country when calculating the institution-specific countercyclical
buffer.
(7) Where the competent authority of a non-EEA state has not defined and published a
countercyclical buffer rate, BaFin may define the rate which the institutions authorised in
Germany must apply to the exposures located in that country when calculating the institutionspecific countercyclical buffer.
(8) Where the competent authority of a non-EEA state has defined and published a
countercyclical buffer rate, BaFin may define a higher countercyclical buffer rate which the
institutions authorised in Germany must apply to the exposures located in that country when
calculating the institution-specific countercyclical buffer if it may assume with reasonable
assurance that the rate defined by the competent authority of the non-EEA state is
insufficient to protect the institutions to an appropriate extent from the risks of excessive
credit growth in the non-EEA state concerned.
(9) Where BaFin recognises a countercyclical buffer rate pursuant to subsection (6) or
defines a countercyclical buffer rate pursuant to subsection (7) or (8), BaFin will in each case
publish this rate on its website and also provide at least the following additional information:
1

the EEA state or non-EEA state for which this rate shall apply,

2

the date from which the institutions authorised in Germany must apply the
countercyclical buffer rate when calculating their institution-specific countercyclical
buffer,

3

in those cases in which this date is less than twelve months after the publication date
pursuant to this subsection, the exceptional circumstances which justify a shorter time
period for application.

(10) More detailed information will be set forth in the statutory order pursuant to section 10
(1) sentence 1 number 5 letter (a).
Section 10e
Systemic risk capital buffer
(1) 1In addition to the Common Equity Tier 1 capital required for compliance with
1

the own funds requirement pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

2

higher own funds requirements to hedge risks and risk elements which are not
covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 pursuant to section 10 (3),

62

Section 10e

3

higher own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (4)

4

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c, and

5

the institution-specific countercyclical buffer pursuant to section 10d,

BaFin may order all institutions or certain types or groups of institutions to maintain a
systemic risk capital buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. 2The systemic risk
buffer may be set for exposures located in Germany, another EEA state or a non-EEA state.
3
This rate will be at least 1.0% of the risk-weighted exposure values of these exposures
which are included in the total risk exposure amount to be calculated pursuant to Article 92
(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the rate will be set by BaFin in gradients of 0.5
percentage point. 4Sentences 1 to 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to groups of institutions,
financial holding groups and mixed financial holding groups which include at least one CRR
credit institution which is required to meet the requirements set out in sentences 1 to 3 on an
individual basis as well as to credit institutions within the meaning of Article 22 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013.
(2) 1The systemic risk buffer may be set to mitigate or prevent long-term non-cyclical
systemic or macroprudential risk which
1

may lead to a disruption which has significant effects on the national financial system
and the German real economy, and

2

are not covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

2

The systemic risk buffer may be set only if these risks cannot be mitigated or prevented with
reasonable assurance by other measures under this Act with the exception of measures
pursuant to section 48t or pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 with the exception of
measures pursuant to Articles 458 and 459 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 3The systemic
risk buffer may be set only if it does not disproportionately impair the financial system or
parts of the financial system of another EEA state or of the European Economic Area as a
whole, such that the functioning of the EEA internal market is impeded. 4The systemic risk
buffer shall be reviewed at least every two years.
(3) 1Before setting a systemic risk buffer, BaFin shall notify the European Commission, EBA,
the ESRB as well as the competent authorities of the other EEA states and non-EEA states
affected thereby of its intention to set such a buffer. 2For a buffer rate of up to 3%, they shall
be notified one month prior to its imposition. 3The notifications should in each case contain at
least the following information:
1

an exact description of the long-term non-cyclical systemic or macroprudential risk
that is to be prevented or mitigated by setting the systemic risk buffers;

2

the reasons why the risk set out in number 1 poses a risk to financial stability at the
national level that justifies setting the systemic risk buffer at the intended level;

63

Section 10e

3

the justification for why the systemic risk buffer in its specific design is considered
likely to be effective and proportionate to prevent or mitigate the risk set out in
number 1;

4

an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the imposition of the
systemic risk buffer on the internal market based on all the information available to
BaFin;

5

the justification for why none of the existing measures under this Act or Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013, excluding measures pursuant to Articles 458 and 459 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, alone or in combination, will be sufficient to prevent or
mitigate the risk set out in number 1, taking into account the relative effectiveness of
those measures;

6

the intended level of the systemic risk buffer.

(4) 1A systemic risk buffer of up to 3.0% may be set in respect of exposures located in
Germany and in non-EEA states. 2A systemic risk buffer of up to 3.0% may be set in respect
of exposures located in another EEA state insofar as this is done uniformly for all exposures
located in EEA states. 3A systemic risk buffer that is to be set at more than 3.0% may be set
only after the European Commission has adopted an affirmative legal act pursuant to
Article 133 (15) of Directive 2013/36/EU.
(5) 1In derogation from subsection (4) sentence 3, BaFin may set a systemic risk buffer rate
of more than 3.0% and up to 5.0% in respect of exposures located in Germany or in nonEEA states after
1

the European Commission has issued an affirmative recommendation or, where the
European Commission has issued a negative recommendation,

2

BaFin has given the European Commission a justification why, contrary to the
European Commission's recommendation, the imposition of the buffer is necessary.

2

If the imposition of the systemic risk buffer pursuant to sentence 1 also affects institutions
whose parent institution is established in another EEA state, BaFin may set the systemic risk
buffer only if it has previously notified the competent authority of the country concerned, the
European Commission and the ESRB of its intention to set a systemic risk buffer pursuant to
sentence 1 in respect of these institutions as well. 3If the competent authority of an affected
EEA state objects, within one month, to the imposition of the systemic risk buffer pursuant to
sentence 1 in respect of an institution whose parent institution is established in that state, or
if both the European Commission and the ESRB issue, within one month, negative
recommendations, BaFin may refer the matter to EBA for implementation of a procedure to
settle disagreements pursuant to Article19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

(6) 1The systemic risk buffer may also be set and be made public as an administrative order
(Allgemeinverfügung) without prior consultation. 2The setting of the systemic risk buffer shall
be published on BaFin's website. 3The publication shall contain at least the following
information:
64

Section 10f

1

the systemic risk buffer rate,

2

the institutions, types or groups of institutions to which the systemic risk buffer
applies,

3

a justification for the systemic risk buffer,

4

the date from which the institutions must apply the systemic risk buffer,

5

the names of the countries where exposures located in those countries are
recognised in the systemic risk buffer.

4

Publication pursuant to number 3 shall be waived if there is a danger that it might jeopardise
financial market stability.
(7) Subsection (6) sentences 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the withdrawal of a
systemic risk buffer.
(8) 1BaFin may recognise the systemic risk buffer which was set in another EEA state by
ordering all institutions or types or groups of institutions to apply the systemic risk buffer
ordered in that country insofar as it relates to exposures located in that country.
2
Subsection (6) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such recognition. 3When deciding whether to
recognise a systemic risk buffer rate, BaFin shall take into consideration the information
presented by the other state that sets that buffer rate. 4BaFin shall notify the European
Commission, EBA, the ESRB and the state that sets that systemic risk buffer rate of its
recognition.
(9) BaFin may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of
Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more other EEA states to recognise the systemic
risk buffer rate.
(10) Further details will be set forth in the statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1)
sentence 1 number 5 letter (b).
Section 10f
Capital buffer for global systemically important institutions
(1) 1BaFin will order global systemically important institutions, in addition to maintaining the
Common Equity Tier 1 capital required to comply with
1

the own funds requirements pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

2

higher own funds requirements to hedge risks and risk elements pursuant to
section 10 (3) which are not covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

3

higher own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (4),

4

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c,

5

the institution-specific countercyclical buffer pursuant to section 10d, and

65

Section 10f

6

the systemic buffer pursuant to section 10e insofar as it is not counted towards the
buffer for global systemically important institutions,

to maintain a capital buffer for global systemically important institutions (G-SII buffer) on a
consolidated basis consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. 2BaFin will set this rate at
1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5% or 3.5% of the total risk exposure amount determined pursuant to
Article 92 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in line with the size category to which the
global systemically important institution has been assigned and shall review the rate at least
annually.
(2) 1BaFin, in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, will identify at least annually which
institutions, EU parent institutions, EU parent financial holding companies or EU parent
mixed financial holding companies established in Germany are to be classified on the basis
of a quantitative analysis as globally systemically important (global systemically important
institutions) on a consolidated basis. 2Its quantitative analysis shall take into account the
following categories:
1

size of the group,

2

cross-border activities of the group,

3

interconnectedness of the group with the financial system,

4

substitutability of the services or of the financial infrastructure provided by the group,
and

5

complexity of the group.

3

Institutions are required to report the microdata needed to perform the quantitative analysis
annually to BaFin and to the Deutsche Bundesbank.

(3) 1Depending on the results of the quantitative analysis, BaFin will assign a global
systemically important institution to a particular size category. 2BaFin may
1

assign a global systemically important institution to a higher size category, or

2

designate an institution that is required to participate in the quantitative procedure,
and which was identified by the quantitative analysis as not being a global
systemically important institution, as such and assign it to one of the size categories
if, as part of the supplementary qualitative analysis, characteristics of systemic
importance were identified which were not captured or were inadequately captured by
the quantitative analysis.

(4) 1Institutions are required to publish the indicators underlying the quantitative analysis
annually. 2BaFin shall take into account, at its own discretion, the relevant guidelines and
recommendations published by EBA and the ESRB when ordering and reviewing the buffer
for global systemically important institutions pursuant to subsection (1) and when classifying
institutions as global systemically important institutions as well as when assigning them to a
size category pursuant to subsections (2) and (3).
66

Section 10g

(5) BaFin will notify EBA, the ESRB, the European Commission and the institutions classified
as global systemically important institutions of the decisions pursuant to subsections (1) to
(3) and publish information on the existence of a buffer order and the buffer rate for global
systemically important institutions as well as a list of the institutions classified as global
systemically important institutions.
(6) Further details will be set forth in the statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1
number 5 letter (c).
Section 10g
Capital buffer for other systemically important institutions
(1) BaFin may order other systemically important institutions, in addition to maintaining the
Common Equity Tier 1 capital required for compliance with
1

the own funds requirements pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

2

higher own funds requirements to hedge risks and risk elements pursuant to
section 10 (3) which are not covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

3

higher own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (4),

4

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c,

5

the institution-specific countercyclical buffer pursuant to section 10d, and

6

the systemic buffer pursuant to section 10e insofar as it is not counted towards the
buffer for global systemically important institutions,

to maintain a capital buffer for other systemically important institutions (O-SII buffer) of up to
2.0% of the total risk exposure amount determined pursuant to Article 92 (3) of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated, sub-consolidated or individual basis consisting of
Common Equity Tier 1 capital.
(2) 1BaFin, in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, will identify at least annually which
institutions, EU parent institutions, EU parent financial holding companies or EU parent
mixed financial holding companies established in Germany shall be classified as other
systemically important (other systemically important institutions) on a consolidated basis,
sub-consolidated or individual basis. 2In performing the qualitative and quantitative analysis
at the relevant level, BaFin will notably take into account the following factors:
1

size,

2

economic importance for the EEA and the Federal Republic of Germany,

3

cross-border activities, and

4

interconnectedness with the financial system.

(3) 1BaFin will review, at least annually, whether and at what rate the buffer for other
systemically important institution is required. 2It shall in each case take note of any relevant
67

Section 10h
guidelines and recommendations published by EBA and the ESRB. 3A capital buffer for other
systemically important institutions may be imposed only if does not entail disproportionate
adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system of another EEA state or of the
European Economic Area as a whole, forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of
the EEA internal market.
(4) 1At least one month before the publication of the decision to set or reset a buffer for other
systemically important institutions, BaFin shall notify EBA, the ESRB and the European
Commission as well as the competent authorities of any EEA states which may be affected
of the proposed decision. 2Each notification shall contain at least the following information:
1

a detailed justification for why the setting of an O-SII buffer is justified and is
proportionate to the risk identified,

2

a detailed assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the O-SII buffer on
the EEA internal market, and

3

the buffer rate that is to be set.

(5) BaFin will notify the respective other systemically important institution, EBA, the ESRB
and the European Commission of the decisions pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) and
publish a list of the institutions classified as being other systemically important institutions.
(6) Where the other systemically important institution is a subsidiary of
1

a global systemically important institution, or

2

an EU parent institution established abroad which is another systemically important
institution within the meaning of Article 131 (1) of Directive 2013/36/EU and is subject
to an O-SII buffer on a consolidated basis,

the buffer rate pursuant to subsection (2) shall not exceed the higher of 1.0% or of the buffer
on a consolidated basis pursuant to Article 131 (4) or (5) of Directive 2013/36/EU.
(7) Further details will be set forth in the statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1
number 5 letter (d).
Section 10h
Combination of a systemic risk buffer, a buffer for global systemically important
institutions and a buffer for other systemically important institutions
(1) Where a group is subject to a G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f and also to an O-SII
buffer pursuant to section 10g on a consolidated basis, only the higher of the two buffers
shall apply.
(2) Where a group is subject to a G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f and also to
1

an O-SII buffer pursuant to section 10g on a consolidated basis exists, and

68

Section 10i

2

a systemic risk buffer pursuant to section 10e on a consolidated basis that was set
not only for exposures located in the EEA state setting the buffer concerned,

only the highest of the three buffers shall apply.
(3) Where an institution, on an individual or sub-consolidated basis, is subject to an O-SII
buffer pursuant to section 10g and a systemic risk buffer pursuant to section 10e that was set
not only for exposures located in the EEA state setting the buffer concerned, only the higher
of the two buffers shall apply.
(4) Where a systemic risk buffer pursuant to section 10e has been set solely for exposures
located in the EEA state setting the buffer concerned, this buffer shall apply in addition to a
G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f or an O-SII buffer pursuant to section 10g.
Section 10i
Combined buffer requirement
(1) The combined buffer requirement is the total Common Equity Tier 1 capital of an
institution which is required to comply with the following capital buffer requirements:
1

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c,

2

the institution-specific countercyclical buffer pursuant to section 10d, and

3

in cases relating and pursuant to
(a) section 10h (1), the higher of the G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f and the OSII buffer pursuant to section 10g,
(b) section 10h (2), the highest of the G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f, the O-SII
buffer pursuant to section 10g and the systemic risk buffer pursuant to
section 10e,
(c) section 10h (3), the higher of the systemic risk buffer pursuant to section 10e and
the O-SII buffer pursuant to section 10g, or
(d) section 10h (4), the sum of the systemic risk buffer pursuant to section 10e and
the G-SII buffer pursuant to section 10f or the O-SII buffer pursuant to
section 10g.

(2) An institution which meets the combined buffer requirement shall not make a distribution
in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 capital or Common Equity Tier 1 capital
instruments pursuant to subsection (5) to an extent that would decrease its Common Equity
Tier 1 capital to a level where the combined buffer requirement is no longer met.
(3) 1An institution which does not meet or no longer meets the combined buffer requirement
shall calculate the maximum distributable amount (MDA) and notify BaFin and the Deutsche
Bundesbank of that MDA. 2The institution shall maintain arrangements to ensure that the
amount of distributable profits and the maximum distributable amount are calculated
accurately, and must be able to demonstrate that accuracy to BaFin and the Deutsche
69

Section 10i
Bundesbank upon request. 3Until BaFin has decided on the approval of the capital
conservation plan pursuant to subsections (7) and (8), the credit institution shall not
1

make a distribution in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 capital or Common
Equity Tier 1 capital instruments pursuant to subsection (5),

2

create an obligation to pay variable remuneration or discretionary pension benefits or
pay variable remuneration if the obligation to pay was created at a time when the
credit institution failed to meet the combined buffer requirement, and

3

make payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments.

4

Further details will be set forth in the statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1
number 5 letter (e).
(4) Where an institution does not meet or no longer meets the combined buffer requirement
and intends to distribute any of its distributable profits or undertake an action pursuant to
subsection (3) sentence 3 numbers 1 to 3, it shall notify this intention to BaFin and the
Deutsche Bundesbank and provide the following information:
1

the amount of capital maintained by the institution, subdivided as follows:
(a) Common Equity Tier 1 capital;
(b) Additional Tier 1 capital;
(c) Tier 2 capital;

2

the amount of its interim and year-end profits;

3

the maximum distributable amount;

4

the amount of distributable profits and how it intends to allocate them between the
following:
(a) dividend payments;
(b) share buybacks;
(c) payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments;
(d) the payment of variable remuneration or discretionary pension benefits, whether
by creation of a new obligation to pay, or payment pursuant to an obligation to
pay created at a time when the institution failed to meet its combined buffer
requirement.

(5) A distribution in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 capital or Common Equity Tier 1
capital instruments shall include the following:
1

a payment of cash dividends,

2

a distribution of fully or partly paid bonus shares or other capital instruments referred
to in Article 26 (1) letter (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

70

Section 10i

3

a redemption or purchase by an institution of its own shares or other capital
instruments referred to in Article 26 (1) letter (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,

4

a repayment of amounts paid up in connection with capital instruments referred to in
Article 26 (1) letter (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and

5

a distribution of items referred to in Article 26 (1) letters (b) to (e) of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013.

(6) 1An institution which does not meet or no longer meets its combined buffer requirement
shall, in addition to the requirements set out in subsections (3) to (4), also prepare a capital
conservation plan and submit it to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank no later than five
working days after it identified that it was failing to meet the combined buffer requirement.
2
BaFin may authorise a longer delay of up to ten working days for submission if this appears
appropriate on the basis of the individual situation of the credit institution and taking into
account the scale and complexity of the institution's activities. The capital conservation plan
shall include the following:
1

estimates of income and expenditure and a forecast balance sheet,

2

measures to increase the capital ratios of the institution,

3

a plan and timeframe for the increase of own funds with the objective of fully meeting
the combined buffer requirement, and

4

any other information that BaFin considers to be necessary to carry out the
assessment required by subsection (7).

(7) 1BaFin will assess the capital conservation plan, and will approve the plan only if it
considers that the plan, if implemented, would be reasonably likely to conserve or raise
sufficient capital to enable the institution to meet its combined buffer requirements within a
period which BaFin considers appropriate. 2BaFin will decide on the approval within 14 days
of receiving the capital conservation plan. 3Once the capital conservation plan has been
approved, the institution may distribute distributable profits and implement measures
pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 3 numbers 1 to 3 up to the maximum distributable
amount.
(8) 1If BaFin does not approve the capital conservation plan,
1

BaFin will order that the restrictions on distributions pursuant to subsection (3) shall
continue to apply, or

2

BaFin shall allow the institution to implement measures within the meaning of
subsection (3) sentence 3 numbers 1 to 3 up to a certain amount which shall not to
exceed the maximum distributable amount.

2

It may also require the institution to increase its own funds to a specified level within a
specified period.

71

Section 11

(9) The restrictions imposed by this provision apply only to payments and distributions that
result in a reduction of Common Equity Tier 1 capital or in a reduction of profits, and to the
extent that a suspension of payment or failure to pay does not constitute an event of default
or a condition for the commencement of proceedings under the insolvency regime applicable
to the institution.
Section 11
Liquidity
(1) 1Institutions shall invest their funds in such a way as to ensure that adequate funds for
payment outflows (liquidity) are available at all times. 2The Federal Ministry of Finance is
authorised, by way of a statutory order issued in consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank,
to lay down more detailed liquidity adequacy requirements, in particular in respect of
1

methods for assessing liquidity adequacy and the requisite technical standards,

2

business transactions that are to be recognised as liquid assets and payment
obligations, including their assessment basis, and

3

the institutions’ duty to provide BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank with the
information required to demonstrate liquidity adequacy, including provisions on the
contents, nature, scope and form of the information, on the frequency of provision
thereof and on the permissible data storage media, transmission channels and data
formats.

3

The statutory order shall be consistent with the definition of savings deposits given in
section 21 (4) of the Regulation on the Accounting of Credit Institutions and Financial
Services Institutions (Kreditinstituts-Rechnungslegungsverordnung). 4The Federal Ministry of
Finance may delegate this authority by way of a statutory order to BaFin, subject to the
proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank. 5The
central associations representing the institutions shall be consulted before the statutory order
is issued.
(2) When assessing institutions' liquidity, BaFin may in individual cases order institutions to
meet liquidity requirements which go beyond the statutory order pursuant to subsection (1) if
an institution's ongoing liquidity is not assured without such a measure.
(3) 1When assessing institutions' liquidity, BaFin may in individual cases order institutions,
groups of institutions, financial holding groups and mixed financial holding groups to meet
liquidity requirements which go beyond the requirements of Articles 411 to 428 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as last amended so as to cover specific risks to which an institution is or
may be exposed. 2In so doing, BaFin will take into account the criteria set out in Article 105 of
Directive 2013/36/EU as last amended. 3BaFin may additionally impose restrictions on
maturity transformation. 4Section 10a subsections (1) to (3) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

72

Section 12

(4) BaFin may order an institution, group of institutions, financial holding group or mixed
financial holding group to submit more frequent or more comprehensive reports on its
liquidity.
Section 12
(Repealed)
Section 12a
Establishment of corporate relationships
(1) 1An institution, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company, when
acquiring a participation in an undertaking established outside Germany or when establishing
a corporate link with such an undertaking via which the undertaking becomes a subordinated
undertaking within the meaning of section 10a, shall ensure that it or, in the case of a
financial holding company or mixed financial holding company, the superordinated
undertaking responsible for consolidation obtains the information required to meet the
respective obligations pursuant to sections 10a and 25 (1). 2Sentence 1 shall not apply to the
information required to meet the respective obligations pursuant to section 10a if an
institution is unable to obtain the information required for consolidation for individual group
entities pursuant to section 10a and the deduction of book values to be carried out pursuant
to Article 36 in conjunction with Article 19 (2) letter (a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as
last amended takes into account, in a manner similar to consolidation pursuant to
section 10a (4) or (5), the risk entailed in acquiring the participation or establishing the
corporate link and enables BaFin to assess compliance with this requirement. 3The
institution, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company shall notify BaFin
and the Deutsche Bundesbank without delay of the establishment, modification or
discontinuation of a participation or close link as specified in sentence 1.
(2) 1BaFin may prohibit the continuation of the participation or corporate link if the
superordinated undertaking or the institution within the meaning of Article 22 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 does not obtain the data required to meet the respective obligations
pursuant to sections 10a, 13 (3), section 25 (1) or pursuant to the statutory orders pursuant
to section 10 (1) sentence 1 or section 13 (1) sentence 1 as well as pursuant to Articles 11 to
17 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended. 2The derogation pursuant to
subsection (1) sentence 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the powers of prohibition conferred
by sentence 1.

Large exposures; authority to issue orders
(1) 1The Federal Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, shall be
authorised, by way of a statutory order that does not require the consent of the Bundesrat, to
adopt, in the interests of the proper protection of institutions, groups of institutions, financial
holding groups and mixed financial holding groups, more detailed provisions in respect of
concentration risks as a supplement to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for large exposures

data formats of notifications of master data on large exposures and well as feedback
thereon as part of the large exposure reporting procedure pursuant to Article 394 (1)
to (3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended,

on the requirements which will be effective, until such time as the implementing
technical standards pursuant to Article 394 (4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 have
come into effect, regarding the nature, scope, timing and form of the information as
well as the permissible data storage media, transmission channels and data formats
of large exposure notifications pursuant to Article 394 (1) to (3) of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 and regarding the notification obligations existing under these
provisions, which may be supplemented by the obligation to submit summary reports,
insofar as this is necessary for the performance of BaFin's tasks, and especially to
enable it to obtain consistent records for assessing the exposures entered into by the
institutions, and

5

on the implementation of the exemption, permitted by Article 493 (3) of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as last amended, of certain exposures from the application of
Article 395 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended.

2

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order, subject to the proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 3The central associations representing the institutions are to be consulted
before the statutory order is issued.
(2) 1An institution organised in the form of a legal person or a commercial partnership may –
without prejudice to the validity of the legal transactions – incur a large exposure only by
virtue of a unanimous decision by all its senior managers. 2The decision should be taken
before the exposure is incurred. 3If this is not possible in individual cases owing to the
urgency of the transaction, then the decision is to be taken promptly thereafter. 4The decision
74

Section 13a
is to be placed on record. 5If the large exposure has been incurred without a prior unanimous
decision by all the senior managers and if the decision is not taken retrospectively within one
month of the exposure having been incurred, the institution is to promptly notify BaFin and
the Deutsche Bundesbank of this fact. 6If an exposure which has already been incurred
becomes a large exposure owing to a reduction in the eligible capital pursuant to Article 4 (1)
number 71 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the institution may maintain this exposure –
without prejudice to the validity of the legal transaction – only by virtue of a unanimous
decision by all its senior managers to be taken promptly thereafter. 7The decision is to be
placed on record. 8If the decision is not taken retrospectively within one month starting from
the date on which the exposure became a large exposure, the institution is to promptly notify
BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank of this fact.
(3) The decision-making requirements pursuant to subsection (2) shall apply mutatis
mutandis to the superordinated undertaking if an undertaking of the group of institutions,
financial holding group or mixed financial holding group makes use of Article 7 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013.
(4) 1In the case of loans from public promotional funds which the promotional institutions of
the Federal Government and of state governments pass through to ultimate borrowers on the
basis of independent loan agreements – if necessary via further pass-through institutions –
via principal banks on predefined terms (principal bank principle), with regard to the
application of Article 395 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for the institutions concerned,
the individual ultimate borrowers may be deemed to be the borrowers of the interbank loan
granted by the institutions if the credit exposures are assigned to the institutions as collateral.
2
This shall apply mutatis mutandis to interest-subsidised loans granted by the promotional
institutions using their own or public funds in accordance with the principal bank principle
(own resources programmes), as well as to loans granted using non-public funds which a
credit institution passes through to ultimate borrowers – if necessary via further pass-through
institutions – via principal banks in accordance with statutory requirements.

Section 13c
Intra-group transactions with mixed-activity holding companies
(1) 1A CRR institution which is a subsidiary of a mixed-activity holding company is to notify
BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank of any significant intra-group transactions with mixedactivity holding companies or other subsidiaries of such mixed-activity holding companies.
2
The Federal Ministry of Finance shall be authorised, by way of a statutory order – not
requiring the consent of the Bundesrat – to be issued in consultation with the Deutsche
Bundesbank, to specify in more detail:
75

Section 13c

1

the types of transactions to be notified and the thresholds used to identify which intragroup transactions are to be deemed significant transactions;

2

the limits for intra-group transactions and any restrictions with regard to the nature of
intra-group transactions;

3

the nature, scope, timing and form of the information as well as the permissible data
storage media and transmission channels.

3

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order provided that the statutory order is to be issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 4The central associations representing the institutions are to be consulted
before the statutory order is issued.
(2) The CRR institution within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 may – without
prejudice to the validity of the legal transactions – conduct significant intra-group transactions
with mixed-activity holding companies or other subsidiaries of such mixed-activity holding
companies only by virtue of a unanimous decision by all its senior managers; section 13 (2)
sentences 2 to 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(3) 1Without prejudice to the validity of the legal transactions, the CRR institution within the
meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 may not, without BaFin‘s permission, conduct any
significant intra-group transactions with mixed-activity holding companies or other
subsidiaries of such mixed-activity holding companies which exceed the limits laid down in
the statutory order pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 or violate the restrictions regarding
the nature of significant intra-group transactions laid down in the statutory order. 2BaFin may
give permission pursuant to sentence 1 at its own discretion. 3Regardless of whether BaFin
gives permission, the institution is to notify BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank promptly if
the limits are exceeded or if the restrictions with regard to the nature of intra-group
transactions are violated. 4BaFin may
1

require the CRR institution within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 to back
the excess amount with own funds if the limits set in the statutory order pursuant to
subsection (1) sentence 2 are exceeded;

2

use appropriate and necessary measures to stop or prevent violations of the
restrictions regarding the nature of intra-group transactions laid down in the statutory
order pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2.

(4) 1In order to identify, quantify, monitor and manage significant intra-group transactions
within a mixed-activity group, the CRR institutions belonging to the group must have an
appropriate risk management structure and appropriate internal control mechanisms,
including a proper reporting system and proper accounting procedures; this is without
prejudice to section 13. 2Section 10a (8), section 25a (1) sentence 2 as well as Article 11 (1)
sentences 2 and 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

meaning of Annex 3 number 1 of Directive 2004/39/EC, financial services institutions within
the meaning of section 1 (1a) sentence 2 number 4, 9 or 10, financial institutions within the
meaning of Article 4 (4), number 26 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in conjunction with
Annex 1 number 2 of Directive 2013/36/EU that engage in factoring and the undertakings
and agencies mentioned in section 2 (2) (undertakings participating in the reporting
procedures for loans of €1.5 million or more ) shall report to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s
Central Credit Register (Evidenzzentrale) on a quarterly basis (observation period) those
borrowers whose credit volume amounts to €1,500,000 or more (threshold for loans of
€1.5 million or more); contents of the reports, reporting deadlines and more detailed
provisions on the observation period shall be laid down in the statutory order pursuant to
section 22. 2At the same time, superordinated undertakings within the meaning of section
10a shall report in respect of the undertakings belonging to the group within the meaning of
sentence 1, which is to be applied as appropriate. 3This shall not apply if these undertakings
are themselves required to submit reports pursuant to sentence 1 or if they are exempt or
released from the reporting requirement pursuant to section 2 (4), (7), (8) or (9a) or if the
book value of the participating interest in the undertakings belonging to the group is deducted
from the superordinated undertaking’s own funds pursuant to Article 36 in conjunction with
section 19 (2) sentence a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended. 4Those
undertakings belonging to the group which are not themselves required to submit reports
pursuant to sentence 1 shall transmit the requisite data to the superordinated undertaking.
5
In the case of syndicated loans of €1 million or more, sentence 1 shall apply even if the
share of the individual undertaking does not amount to €1 million.
(2) 1If it is found that loans of €1.5 million or more have been granted to a single borrower by
more than one undertaking, the Deutsche Bundesbank shall notify the reporting
undertakings. 2This notification shall include information about the borrower’s aggregate
indebtedness and the aggregate indebtedness of the single borrower unit to which the
borrower belongs, about the number of undertakings involved as well as information about
the forecast probability of default within the meaning of the Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 in respect of this borrower if an undertaking has itself reported such a
probability of default. 3The notification shall be structured in accordance with the regulation
pursuant to section 22. 4The Deutsche Bundesbank shall notify an undertaking required to
submit reports at the latter's request of the indebtedness of a borrower or anticipated
borrower or, if the borrower or anticipated borrower forms part of a single borrower unit, of
the indebtedness of the single borrower unit. 5In the case of an anticipated borrower, the
undertaking shall inform the Deutsche Bundesbank upon request of the amount of the
intended loan and prove that the anticipated borrower has consented to the disclosure of this
information. 6The undertakings participating in the reporting procedures for loans of €1.5

(1), the notification pursuant to sentence 1 and the information pursuant to sentence 4 also
by electronic data transmission. 7The details of the procedures shall be stipulated in the
regulation pursuant to section 22. 8The Deutsche Bundesbank may transmit personal data
relating to several borrowers to the reporting undertaking to the extent that this is necessary
for the purpose of assigning the report pursuant to subsection (1) to a particular borrower.
9
Such data may not contain information about the financial circumstances of the borrowers.
10
The persons employed by an undertaking required to submit reports may not disclose
information notified to the undertaking pursuant to this subsection to third parties and may
not exploit such information. 11For the purpose of monitoring the protection of data on the
part of the responsible parties, the Deutsche Bundesbank shall log the time, the data
transmitted, and the parties involved during each transmission of data. 12The log data may
not be used for purposes other than those specified above. 13The log data shall be kept for at
least 18 months and must be deleted at the latest after 24 months.
(3) 1If several debtors are deemed to be a single borrower pursuant to section 19 (2), the
indebtedness and information about the forecast probabilities of default of the individual
debtors shall also be indicated in the reports pursuant to subsection (1). 2The indebtedness
of individual debtors and the information about the forecast probabilities of default shall be
imparted only to those undertakings which themselves, or whose undertakings belonging to
the group within the meaning of subsection (1), have incurred an exposure to these debtors
or have reported information about the forecast probabilities of default of these debtors.
(4) The Deutsche Bundesbank may, in agreement with BaFin and pursuant to section 4b of
the Federal Data Protection Act, provide credit registers in other countries with data which it
holds on borrowers, including for the purposes of forwarding to lenders located in those
countries.

Loans to managers etc
(1) 1Loans to
1

senior managers of the institution,

2

partners of the institution who are not senior managers if the institution is organised in
the form of a commercial partnership or private limited company, and to general
partners of an institution who are not senior managers if the institution is organised in
the form of a limited partnership company,

3

members of a governing body of the institution appointed to monitor the management
of the institution if the monitoring powers of the body are laid down by law
(supervisory body),

4

holders of a general commercial power of attorney and authorised officers of the
institution empowered to represent it in all aspects of its business,

5

spouses, life partners and minors of the persons specified in numbers 1 to 4,
78

Section 15

6

silent partners of the institution,

7

undertakings organised in the form of a legal person or commercial partnership if a
senior manager, a holder of a general commercial power of attorney or an authorised
officer of the institution empowered to represent it in all aspects of its business is a
legal representative or a member of the supervisory body of the legal person or a
partner in the commercial partnership,

8

undertakings organised in the form of a legal person or commercial partnership if a
legal representative of the legal person, a partner in the commercial partnership, a
holder of a general commercial power of attorney or an authorised officer of this
undertaking empowered to represent it in all aspects of its business is a member of
the supervisory body of the institution,

9

undertakings in which the institution or a senior manager holds a participating interest
of more than 10% of the undertaking's capital or in which the institution or a senior
manager is a general partner,

10

undertakings which hold a participating interest in the institution of more than 10% of
the institution's capital,

11

undertakings organised in the form of a legal person or commercial partnership if a
legal representative of the legal person or a partner in the commercial partnership
holds a participating interest in the institution of more than 10% of its capital, and

12

general partners, senior managers, members of the executive board or supervisory
body, holders of a general commercial power of attorney and authorised officers
empowered to represent in all aspects of business of an undertaking controlled by or
controlling the institution, as well as their spouses, life partners and minors,

(loans to managers etc) may be granted only by virtue of a unanimous decision by all of the
institution's senior managers and – other than as part of staff programmes – only on market
terms and with the explicit permission of the supervisory body or, in the case of number 12,
of the supervisory body of the undertaking controlling the institution; the above provisions
pertaining to commercial partnerships shall apply mutatis mutandis to other partnerships. 2A
unanimous decision by all senior managers and the explicit approval of the supervisory body
may be dispensed with if a CRSA risk weight of 0% can be applied to a loan to an
undertaking pursuant to sentence 1 numbers 9 and 10 in accordance with Article 113 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 3A participating interest within the meaning of sentence 1
numbers 9 to 11 shall be deemed to be any holding of shares in the undertaking amounting
to not less than one-quarter of the capital (nominal capital, sum total of the capital shares),
irrespective of the duration of the holding. 4The authorisation of withdrawals in excess of the
remuneration due to a senior manager or a member of the supervisory body and, in
particular, the authorisation of advances on such remuneration, shall be deemed to be
equivalent to the granting of a loan. 5Loans to managers etc which are not granted on market
terms shall be backed by liable capital at the decree of BaFin pursuant to Article 26 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended.

79

Section 15
(2) 1In individual cases BaFin may impose upper limits for the granting of loans to managers
etc; it shall be entitled to do so even after such a loan has been granted. 2Loans to managers
etc which exceed the limits imposed by BaFin shall be reduced to the stipulated limits upon a
further order issued by BaFin; in the meantime, they shall be backed with liable capital
pursuant to Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended.
(3) Subsection (1) shall not apply to
1

loans to holders of a general commercial power of attorney or authorised officers of
an institution empowered to represent it in all aspects of its business as well as to
their spouses, life partners and minors if the loan does not exceed the amount of one
annual salary of the holder of a general commercial power of attorney or of the
authorised officer of the institution empowered to represent it in all aspects of its
business,

2

loans to persons or undertakings specified in subsection (1) sentence 1 numbers 6 to
11 if the loan amounts to less than 1% of the institution's liable capital pursuant to
Article 4 (1) number 71 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or to less than €50,000, and

3

loans which are increased by no more than 10% of the amount approved pursuant to
subsection (1) sentence 1.

(4) 1The decision by the senior managers and the decision on approval shall be taken before
the loan is granted. 2The decisions shall include provisions on the interest rate payable on,
and the repayment of, the loan. 3They shall be placed on record. 4If a loan to be granted
pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 numbers 6 to 11 is urgent, it is sufficient if all the
senior managers and the supervisory body promptly approve the granting of the loan
subsequently. 5If the decision by the senior managers has not been taken retrospectively
within two months or the decision by the supervisory body has not been taken retrospectively
within four months of the date on which the loan was granted, the institution shall promptly
notify BaFin of this fact. 6For certain lending operations and types of lending operations, the
decision by the senior managers and the decision on the approval of loans to the persons
specified in subsection (1) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 5 and 12 may be taken in advance, but
no more than one year in advance.
(5) If, contrary to subsection (1) or (4), a loan is granted to a person specified in subsection
(1) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 5 and 12, it shall be repaid immediately, irrespective of any
arrangements to the contrary, unless all of the senior managers and the supervisory body
promptly approve the granting of the loan subsequently.

Liability
(1) If a loan is granted contrary to the provisions of section 15, the managers who thereby
violate their duty and the members of the supervisory body who, in violation of their duty, fail
to intervene to prevent the granting of an intended loan despite having knowledge thereof,
shall be jointly and severally liable to the institution for any loss arising; the onus shall be on
the managers and the members of the supervisory body to prove that they did not act
culpably.
(2) 1The institution's right to compensation may also be asserted by its creditors insofar as
they cannot obtain satisfaction from the institution. 2The liability to compensate the creditors
shall not be annulled by a waiver or by composition on the part of the institution nor, in the
case of institutions organised in the form of a legal person, by the fact that the loan was
granted by virtue of a decision by the institution's supreme body (shareholders' meeting,
general meeting, partners' meeting).
(3) Claims under subsection (1) shall be barred under the Statute of Limitations after five
years.
Section 18
Borrower documentation
(1) 1A credit institution may grant a loan amounting in the aggregate to more than €750,000
or 10% of the institution’s liable capital pursuant to Article 4 (1) number 71 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 only if it requires the borrower to disclose his or her financial situation, in
particular by submitting the annual accounts. 2The credit institution may waive this
requirement if, in the light of the collateral provided or of the co-obligors, there is evidently no
reason to require such disclosure. 3The credit institution may waive the requirement of
ongoing disclosure if
1

the loan is secured by mortgages on residential property that is used by the borrower
himself,

2

the loan does not exceed four-fifths of the loan value of the pledged property within
the meaning of section 16 (1) and (2) of the Pfandbrief Act, and

3

the borrower regularly effects the interest payments and principal repayments owed
by him.

4

Disclosure is not required in the case of loans to
1

central governments or central banks outside Germany, the Federal Government, the
Deutsche Bundesbank or a legally dependent special fund of the Federal Government if

they would be assigned a credit risk standardised approach risk weight (CRSA risk
weight) of 0% without collateral,

multilateral development banks or international organisations if they would be assigned
a CRSA risk weight of 0% without collateral, or

3

regional governments or local authorities in another EEA states, a state government, a
local government, a local government association, a legally dependent special fund of a
state government, a local government or a local government association or public-sector
entities if they would be assigned a CRSA risk weight of 0% without collateral, as well as

(2) 1Before the conclusion of a consumer loan agreement or a contract on remunerated
financial accommodation, institutions shall assess the consumer’s creditworthiness. 2The
assessment may be based on information provided by the consumer and, where required,
information supplied by agencies whose business it is to collect, store or change, for
transmission, personal data which may be used to assess consumers’ creditworthiness. 3In
the case of a change in the net amount of the loan, the data shall be updated. 4In the case of
a significant increase in the net amount of the loan, creditworthiness shall be reassessed.

sentence 1 numbers 1 to 6 is entitled to the transfer of a claim on the part of the refinancing
undertaking or a lien on property held by the refinancing undertaking by way of collateral,
these assets may be entered in a refinancing register kept by the refinancing undertaking;

transaction is to be entered in a separate section.
(1a) Subsection (1) shall apply mutatis mutandis if the exposures and mortgages are held in
trust by the refinancing undertaking.
(2) 1This subsection shall not create an obligation on the part of the refinancing undertaking
or the refinancing intermediary to keep a refinancing register. 2The keeping of a register may

sentence 1 numbers 1 to 6 has a transfer claim, may be entered in a refinancing register kept
by a credit institution or the KfW banking group. 2If the refinancing register also contains
assets which the register-keeping undertaking or another undertaking is obliged to transfer,
then each obligor of transfer is to be entered in a separate section within the same
refinancing register and each refinancing transaction is to be entered in a subsection of this
section.
(2) 1If the refinancing undertaking is a credit institution for which the keeping of its own
refinancing register constitutes an undue burden in terms of the nature and scope of its
business operations, BaFin, upon the refinancing undertaking’s application, shall consent to
the refinancing register being kept by another credit institution. 2BaFin’s consent shall deem
to have been given if it is not denied within one month of the application having been
submitted.

If an asset serves as collateral, the legal basis, scope and ranking of the collateral as
well as the date on which the contract containing the legal basis for the
collateralisation was concluded.

2

With regard to numbers 1 and 4, the information entered shall be deemed to be sufficient if
third parties, in particular, the administrator, the creditors’ trustee, BaFin or an insolvency
administrator, are able to clearly define and identify the entries concerned. 3If the transferee
is a Pfandbrief bank, then it as well as the cover pool monitor appointed pursuant to section 7
(1) of the Pfandbrief Act shall be informed of the entry. 4If the entitled transferee is an

obligor. 2This is without prejudice to section 354a of the Commercial Code as well as any
statutory restraints on disposition.
(5) 1Entries may be deleted only with the consent of the entitled transferee. 2If the entitled
transferee is a Pfandbrief bank or an insurance undertaking, entries may be deleted only with
the consent of the trustee of the Pfandbrief bank or the trustee of the insurance undertaking.
3
The date and time of deletion is to be recorded in all cases. Incorrect entries may be deleted
with the administrator’s consent; (2) sentences 3 and 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 5The

the refinancing undertaking’s assets or registrable assets pursuant to section 22d (2).
(2) 1The administrator of the refinancing register shall ensure, in particular, that
1

the refinancing register contains the information required pursuant to section 22d (2);

issued as part of compulsory enforcement or execution of attachment by way of litigation
pursuant to section 771 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).
(2) 1Entry in the refinancing register does not limit the objections and pleas of third parties
with regard to the registered receivables and rights. 2If the assets entered in the refinancing

or to a third party by the entitled transferee, all objections and pleas can be put forward in the
same way as in the event of assignment. 3The provisions of section 1156 sentence 1 of the
German Civil Code shall not apply. 4If assets entered in the refinancing register serve as

Creditors’ Avoidance of Transfers Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) and sections 129 to 147 of the
Insolvency Code shall remained unaffected.
(4) The effects of sentences 1 to 3 do not prevent the refinancing undertaking, when selling
the registered assets to the entitled transferee, from bearing the risk of their intrinsic value in
whole or in part.

Section 22k

Section 22k
Cessation and transfer of register-keeping activities
(1) 1If all of the entitled transferees entered in the refinancing register and, if the entitled
transferee is a Pfandbrief bank or an insurance undertaking, the trustee of the Pfandbrief
bank or the trustee of the insurance undertaking consent thereto, the keeping of the
refinancing register may cease one month after BaFin has been notified thereof 2If all of the
entitled transferees entered in a refinancing register and, if the entitled transferee is a
Pfandbrief bank or an insurance undertaking, the trustee of the Pfandbrief bank or the trustee
of the insurance undertaking consent thereto, the keeping of a register may be transferred
under BaFin’s supervision to a suitable credit institution provided that the registered assets
are those of the credit institution taking over the register or the conditions set out in section
22b regarding the keeping of a refinancing register for third parties have been fulfilled.
2) 1Furthermore, the keeping of the register shall cease if BaFin deems the register-keeping
undertaking to be unsuitable for this activity. 2In this case, the keeping of the register shall be
transferred under BaFin’s supervision to a credit institution which BaFin deems to be suitable
for this activity. 3The provisions of section 22b regarding the keeping of a refinancing register
for third parties shall apply mutatis mutandis.

refinancing register not only for third parties, the insolvency court, upon BaFin’s application,
shall appoint one or two natural persons proposed by BaFin as the creditors’ trustee(s) of the
refinancing register (the creditors’ trustee(s)). 2The court may deviate from BaFin’s
proposal(s) if this appears necessary to ensure proper cooperation between the insolvency
administrator and the creditors’ trustee(s). 3The creditors’ trustee shall receive a certificate of
appointment, which he should return to the insolvency court at the end of his tenure.
(2) 1BaFin shall submit an application pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 if, after
consulting the entitled transferees, this appears necessary for the orderly management of the
assets entered in the refinancing register. 2BaFin is to nominate the administrator of the
refinancing register as the creditors’ trustee of the refinancing register or, if the administrator
is not available or permanently prevented from performing his tasks, the deputy administrator
or another suitable natural person. 3The creditors’ trustee of the refinancing register is to be
dismissed at BaFin’s request if there is good reason for doing so.

section 15 of the Commercial Code shall not apply.
(2) 11If rights on the part of the register-keeping undertaking which are already entered in the
land register ( are entered in the refinancing register, then the appointment of a creditors’
trustee shall be entered in the land register (Grundbuch) at the request of either the
insolvency court or the creditors’ trustee if the type of rights concerned and circumstances
suggest that the transferees’ interests could be at risk without such registration. 2Sentence 1
shall apply as appropriate to rights on the part of the register-keeping undertaking which are
entered in the shipping register (Schiffsregister), the shipbuilding register (Schiffsbauregister)
or the register of liens on aircraft (Register für Pfandrechte an Luftfahrzeugen).
Section 22n
Legal position of the creditors’ trustee
(1) 1The creditors’ trustee shall be subject to supervision by the insolvency court. 2The
insolvency court can ask the creditors’ trustee in particular for information or a report on the
situation and the management at any time. 3In addition, it shall be incumbent upon the
creditors’ trustee to perform the duties of an administrator. 4The creditors’ trustee and the
insolvency administrator must provide one another with all information which may be of
significance for the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the register-keeping
undertaking and for managing the assets entered in the refinancing register.
(2) 1If the register-keeping undertaking was authorised to manage and dispose of the assets
entered in the refinancing register, this right shall pass to the creditors’ trustee. 2In
consultation with the insolvency administrator, the creditors’ trustee shall use all of the
register-keeping undertaking’s facilities that are required for the management of the
registered assets.
(3) 1If the register-keeping undertaking disposes of an asset entered in the refinancing
register after the creditors’ trustee has been appointed, this disposal shall be ineffective. 2The

provisions of sections 892 and 893 of the German Civil Code, sections 16 and 17 of the Act
Governing Rights in Registered Ships and Ships under Construction (Gesetz über Rechte an
eingetragenen Schiffen und Schiffsbauwerken) and sections 16 and 17 of the Act Governing
Rights in Aircraft (Gesetz über Rechte an Luftfahrzeugen) shall remain unaffected. 3If the
register-keeping undertaking disposes of an asset on the day on which the creditors’ trustee
of the refinancing register is appointed, it shall be assumed that the disposal occurred after
the appointment.
(4) 1In performing his management activities, the creditors’ trustee of the refinancing register
must exercise the diligence of a prudent and conscientious creditors’ trustee. 2If the creditors’
trustee of the refinancing register breaches his duties, the entitled transferees and the
register-keeping undertaking can demand compensation for the damage resulting therefrom.
3
This shall not apply if the creditors’ trustee of the refinancing register is not responsible for
the breach of duty.
(5) 1The creditors’ trustee of the refinancing register shall receive appropriate remuneration
and reimbursement of his expenses from BaFin. 2The amounts paid are to be refunded
separately to BaFin by the entitled transferees on a pro rata basis depending on the number
of assets registered on their behalf and, at BaFin’s request, shall be paid in advance. 3If the
refinancing register is kept for third parties, these parties as well as the entitled transferees,
as joint and several debtors, shall be obliged to make refunds and advance payments.

(1) 1Under the conditions set out in section 46, upon BaFin’s application, the court with
jurisdiction at the register-keeping undertaking’s domicile shall appoint one or two persons as
the creditors’ trustee(s). 2BaFin shall submit an application pursuant to sentence 1 if, after
consulting the entitled transferees, this appears necessary for the orderly management of the
assets entered in the refinancing register. 3In the event of imminent risk, this consultation
shall be waived. 4In this case, the entitled transferees shall be consulted afterwards without
delay.
(2) 1The provisions of sections 22l to 22n shall apply with regard to the appointment and
dismissal as well as the legal position of a creditors’ trustee appointed under these
circumstances, whereby the court with jurisdiction at the register-keeping undertaking’s
domicile shall take the place of the insolvency court. 2A good reason within the meaning of
section 22l (2) sentence 3 shall be deemed to exist, in particular, if the conditions set out in
section 46a are no longer applicable. 3In this case, BaFin is to appoint an administrator from
among the creditors’ trustees.

96

Section 22p
(3) 1If insolvency proceedings are initiated over the assets of a register-keeping undertaking
after a creditors’ trustee has been appointed in accordance with subsections (3) and (2) then,

proceedings. 2The insolvency court shall take the place of the court with jurisdiction at the
register-keeping undertaking’s domicile. 3The court with jurisdiction at the register-keeping
undertaking’s domicile must hand over to the insolvency court all documents in connection

and the adequacy of own funds and, if applicable, about the deposit guarantee scheme or
investor compensation scheme to which the institution belongs or about its comparable
protection arrangements within the meaning of section 23a (1) sentence 1. 3If BaFin does not
forward the particulars pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 to the competent authorities of
the host member state, it will notify the institution of its reasons for not doing so within two
months of receiving all the particulars pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2. 4After the report

without delay of its non-notification and its reasons for such non-notification.
(3a) 1If the operator of a multilateral trading system intends to grant trading participants in
other states direct access to its trading system, it shall notify BaFin if this is the first time a
trading participant in the country in question has been granted access. 2BaFin will notify the
competent authorities of the host member state of such intention within one month of

BaFin will access the data stored in the data files by means of an automated procedure and
transmit them to the authority making the request. 3BaFin will verify the permissibility of such
transmission only if it has particular grounds for doing so. 4The responsibility for the
permissibility of the transmission shall lie with the authority making the request. 5BaFin may,
pursuant to section 4b of the Federal Data Protection Act, provide foreign agencies with
information from the data file pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 for the purposes
described in sentence 1. 6Section 9 (1) sentences 5 and 6 and subsection (2) shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 7This is without prejudice to the provisions on international judicial
assistance in criminal matters.
(4) 1For the purpose of monitoring compliance with data protection rules on the part of the
competent agency, BaFin will log the time of each data retrieval, the data used during the
retrieval, the data retrieved, the name of the retriever, the reference number and, if the data

remuneration components for employees and management board members. 2In the absence
of a decision pursuant to sentence 5, the variable remuneration component shall not exceed
100% of the fixed remuneration component for each individual employee or management
board member. 3Institutions may discount the future value of up to 25% of the variable
remuneration component to the point in time when the respective employees or management
board members are notified of the amount of the variable remuneration component for an
assessment period, provided that this part of the variable remuneration component is paid in
the form of instruments which are deferred for at least five years after this notification is
given. 4In cases of deferral, an entitlement and expectant right to this part of the variable
remuneration component shall vest only after the deferral period has elapsed, and during the

unvested portion of this part of the variable remuneration component and not to this part of
the variable remuneration component itself. 5The shareholders, proprietors or members of
the institution may decide whether to approve a higher variable remuneration component
than that stipulated in sentence 2; this higher remuneration component shall not exceed
200% of the fixed remuneration component for each individual employee or management

Outsourcing of activities and processes
(1) 1An institution shall, depending on the nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of
outsourcing to another undertaking activities and processes that are material to the execution
of banking business, financial services or any of an institution’s other usual services, make
appropriate arrangements in order to avoid incurring excessive additional risks. 2Outsourcing
shall impair neither the proper execution of such business and services nor the business
organisation within the meaning of section 25a (1). 3In particular, the institution shall ensure
ongoing appropriate and effective risk management that includes the outsourced activities
and processes.

111

Section 25c
(2) 1Outsourcing shall not entail the delegation of management board responsibility to the
external service provider. 2In the event of outsourcing, the institution shall remain responsible
for ensuring compliance with the legal provisions to be observed by the institution.
(3) 1Outsourcing shall not prevent BaFin from performing its tasks; its right to request
information, right to review and ability to supervise shall be ensured by means of suitable
arrangements with regard to the outsourced activities and processes, including in the event
of outsourcing to an undertaking domiciled in another EEA state or in a non-EEA state. 2This
shall apply mutatis mutandis to the performance of the tasks of the institution’s auditors.
3
Outsourcing shall require a written agreement which lays down the institution’s rights to
ensure compliance with the aforementioned stipulations, including the right to give
instructions and the right to give notice, as well as the corresponding duties on the part of the
external service provider.
(4) 1If BaFin’s right to review and ability to supervise are impaired in connection with
outsourcing, BaFin may, in individual cases, issue orders that are appropriate and necessary
to eliminate this impairment. 2This is without prejudice to BaFin’s powers pursuant to section
25a (2) sentence 2.
Section 25c
Management board members
(1) 1The management board members of an institution shall have the necessary professional
qualifications, be trustworthy and dedicate sufficient time to performing their functions. 2A
prerequisite for the professional qualifications of management board members is that they
have adequate theoretical and practical knowledge of the business concerned, as well as
managerial experience. 3A person shall normally be assumed to have the necessary
professional qualifications if he/she can demonstrate three years' managerial experience at
an institution of comparable size and type of business.
(2) 1The number of directorships which may be held by a member of the management board
at the same time shall take into account individual circumstances and the nature, scale and

3

in which the institution has a significant holding.

4

Directorships at organisations and undertakings which do not pursue predominantly
commercial objectives, in particular undertakings which provide public services, are not
included in the maximum number of directorships pursuant to sentence 1 number 2. 5Taking
into account the specific circumstances and the nature, scope and complexity of the activities
of the institution, group of institutions, financial holding group, financial holding company or
mixed financial holding company, BaFin may permit a management board member to hold
an additional directorship on a supervisory board provided that this does not prevent the
member from devoting sufficient time to performing his/her functions in the undertaking in
question. 6An institution is significant within the meaning of sentence 2 if its total assets equal
or exceed €15 billion on average over the reporting dates of the preceding three completed
financial years; the following institutions are always deemed to be significant:

financial holding group, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company.
(2) 1The supervisory board as a whole shall have the necessary knowledge, skills and
experience to fulfil its control function as well as to assess and monitor the management

company or mixed financial holding company, BaFin may permit a supervisory board
member to hold an additional directorship on a supervisory board in excess of the maximum
number of directorships permitted pursuant to sentence 1 numbers 3 and 4 provided that this
does not prevent the member from devoting sufficient time to performing his/her functions in
the undertaking in question. 6Sentence 1 number 4 shall not apply to heads of the
administration of a local authority, a district or a city which is administrated as an
independent district who are obliged to hold a directorship in a local government undertaking
or local government special-purpose association. 7An institution is significant within the

reporting dates of the preceding three completed financial years; the following institutions are
always deemed to be significant:
1

institutions which, pursuant to Article 6 (4) of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013

(4) Institutions, financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies shall
devote adequate human and financial resources to easing the induction of supervisory board
members and facilitating such training as is necessary to ensure that they maintain the
necessary expertise for the position.
(5) The structure of the remuneration systems for members of the supervisory board must
not cause conflicts of interest with respect to the effective performance of the supervisory
board's oversight function.

119

Section 25d
(6) 1The supervisory board shall oversee the management board, also with regard to its
adherence to the applicable prudential supervisory requirements. 2It shall devote sufficient
time to the discussion of strategies, risks and remuneration systems for management board
members and employees.

riskiness of the activities of the undertaking, the supervisory board of one of the undertakings
specified in subsection (3) sentence 1 shall appoint from among its members committees
pursuant to subsections (8) to (12) which advise and support it in its functions. 2Each
committee shall appoint one of its members as chair. 3The members of the committees shall

particularly in consideration of the criteria pursuant to sentence 1 or for the proper
performance of the supervisory board's control function.

board of an undertaking specified in subsection (3) sentence 1 shall appoint from among its
members a risk committee. The risk committee shall advise the supervisory board on the
undertaking’s current and future overall risk appetite and strategy and support the
supervisory board in monitoring the implementation of this strategy by senior management.

the undertaking's business model and risk structure. 4Where this is not the case, the risk
committee shall require from the management board proposals on how to bring the
conditions in customer business into line with the business model and risk structure, and
monitor their implementation. 5The risk committee shall examine whether incentives provided
by the remuneration system take into consideration the risk, capital and liquidity structure of
the undertaking and the likelihood and timing of earnings. 6This shall be without prejudice to
the tasks of the remuneration committee pursuant to subsection (12). 7The chair of the risk
committee or, if a risk committee has not been established, the chair of the supervisory board
may make direct enquiries to both the head of the internal audit function and the head of the
risk control unit. 8The management board shall be informed thereof. 9Where necessary, the

pursuant to subsection (7) sentence 1. 2BaFin shall be informed thereof. 3Subsections (8)
and (9) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the joint audit and risk committee.
(11) 1Taking into account the criteria pursuant to subsection (7) sentence 1, the supervisory

the undertaking to that effect.
(12) 1Taking into account the criteria pursuant to subsection (7) sentence 1, the supervisory
board of an undertaking specified in subsection (3) sentence 1 shall appoint from among its
members a remuneration committee. 2The remuneration committee
1

shall monitor the adequate structure of the remuneration systems for the
management board and employees and, in particular, the adequate structure of

that BaFin requires in the context of the prohibition pursuant to section 3 (2) and (4) sentence
1 as well as for gauging the nature and scope of the business within the meaning of section 3
(2) sentence 2 and (4) sentence 1. 2It may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a
statutory order, provided that statutory orders by BaFin are issued in agreement with the
Deutsche Bundesbank. 3The central associations of the institutions shall be consulted before
the statutory order is issued.
(5) The supervisory board of the financial trading institution, the CRR credit institution or the
superordinated undertaking of the group of institutions, the financial holding group, the mixed

Section 25h

(2) A credit institution shall have in place internal procedures and control systems which
ensure that the obligations set out in the Regulations pursuant to subsection (1) numbers 1
to 3 are met.
(3) BaFin may issue to an institution and its management board orders which are appropriate
and necessary to prevent or stop violations of the obligations under the regulations pursuant
to subsection (1) numbers 1 to 3.
Section 25h
Internal safeguards
(1) 1Notwithstanding the duties cited in section 25a (1) of this Act and section 9 (1) and (2) of
the Money Laundering Act, institutions as well as financial holding companies and mixed
financial holding companies which are deemed to be superordinated undertakings pursuant
to section 10a (2) sentence 2 or 3 or section 10a shall have in place adequate risk
management as well as policies and procedures for the prevention of money laundering,
terrorist financing or other criminal actions which might jeopardise the institution's assets. 2To
this end, they shall create and update adequate business and customer-related safeguards,
and conduct checks. 3This includes the ongoing development of suitable strategies and
safeguards to prevent the misuse of new financial products and technologies for the purpose
of money laundering and terrorist financing or benefiting the anonymity of business
relationships and transactions.
(2) 1Credit institutions shall operate and update appropriate IT systems which enable them to
identify business relationships and individual transactions in payment operations that appear
dubious or unusual in the light of knowledge of methods of money laundering, terrorist
financing and other criminal actions within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 which is
available publicly or to the credit institution. 2The credit institutions may collect, process and
use personal data insofar as this is necessary to fulfil this duty. 3BaFin may lay down criteria
which, if they are met, allow credit institutions to waive the use of systems pursuant to
sentence 1.
(3) 1The credit institution shall investigate every circumstance that appears dubious or
unusual pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 in order to be able to monitor and assess the
risk involved in the relevant business relationships or transactions and, if necessary, examine
whether grounds exist for making a suspicious transaction report pursuant to section 11 (1)
of the Money Laundering Act or for notifying the appropriate authorities pursuant to section
158 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung). 2The institution shall record
and store appropriate information about these circumstances pursuant to section 8 of the
Money Laundering Act which is necessary to demonstrate to BaFin that these circumstances
do not suggest that an action pursuant to section 261 of the Criminal Code or terrorist
financing has been or is being committed or attempted. 3Subsection (2) sentence 2 shall
apply mutatis mutandis. 4In individual cases, institutions may transmit information to each
other in keeping with their duty to investigate pursuant to sentence 1 if the matter concerns a
striking or unusual circumstance relevant to money laundering, terrorist financing or some
125

Section 25h

other criminal action and there are tangible grounds for believing that the recipient of the
information needs it in order to assess whether the matter should be reported pursuant to
section 11 of the Money Laundering Act or whether the relevant authorities should be notified
pursuant to section 158 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 5The recipient may use the
information solely for the purpose of preventing money laundering, terrorist financing or other
criminal actions and only under the conditions stipulated by the institution transmitting the
information.
(4) 1Institutions shall appoint a compliance officer (money laundering), who shall be directly
subordinate to the management board. 2The compliance officer is responsible for carrying
out the provisions regarding the combating and prevention of money laundering and terrorist
financing and is the contact person for the criminal prosecution authorities, the Federal
Criminal Police Office – Financial Intelligence Unit – and BaFin. 3The compliance officer shall
report direct to the management board. 4For institutions, this applies as the superordinated
undertaking also vis-à-vis a group of institutions or a financial holding group within the
meaning of section 10a, a mixed financial holding group within the meaning of section 10a or
as the parent undertaking also vis-à-vis a financial conglomerate within the meaning of
section 1 (20). 5Institutions shall maintain and effectively deploy the means and procedures
necessary for properly performing the compliance officer's tasks. 6The compliance officer
shall be given unimpeded access to all information, data, records and systems that may be
relevant to performing his/her tasks. 7He/she shall be given sufficient powers to be able to
fulfil his/her function. 8BaFin shall be notified of the compliance officer's appointment and
release from his/her duties.
(5) 1Subject to BaFin's prior consent, institutions may arrange to have internal safeguards
pursuant to this provision carried out by a third party within the scope of contractual
agreements. 2Such consent may be granted if the third party guarantees that the safeguards
will be properly carried out and that the institutions' ability to control and BaFin's ability to
monitor are not impaired.
(6) In individual cases, BaFin may issue orders to an institution that are appropriate and
necessary for making the arrangements specified in subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4).
(7) 1The Federal Republic of Germany – Finance Agency shall be deemed to be an institution
within the meaning of subsections (1) to (5). 2To this extent, the Federal Ministry of Finance
shall monitor compliance with subsections (1) to (5) as part of its supervision pursuant to
section
2
(1)
of
the
Federal
Government
Debt
Management
Act
(Bundesschuldenwesengesetz).
(8) The Deutsche Bundesbank shall be deemed to be an institution within the meaning of
subsections (1) to (4).
(9) 1The function of the compliance officer within the meaning of subsection (4) and the
duties to prevent other criminal actions within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 shall
be performed by one unit within the institution. 2At the institution's request, BaFin can

126

Section 25i

determine that another unit within the institution is to be responsible for the prevention of
other criminal actions if there is a good reason for doing so.
Section 25i
Simplified due diligence
(1) 1Where the conditions specified in section 25k of this Act and section 6 of the Money
Laundering Act do not exist, the institutions may, over and above section 5 of the Money
Laundering Act, apply simplified due diligence, subject to a risk assessment of the institution,
in the following case groups owing to special circumstances in individual cases:
1

subject to sentence 2, upon the conclusion of
(a) a government-subsidised funded pension agreement,
(b) an agreement on the investment of capital formation benefits, provided that the
agreement fulfils the conditions for a government subsidy,
c) a consumer loan agreement or an agreement on remunerated financial
accommodation, provided that number 3 letter (d) is observed,
(d) a credit agreement as part of a government promotion programme that is
processed via a Federal Government or state government promotional bank and
whose loan principal must be used for a specific purpose,
(e) a credit agreement for sales financing,
(f) any other credit agreement in which the credit account is used solely to process
the loan and the loan is repaid from an account held by the borrower with a credit
institution within the meaning of section 1 (1) with the exception of the
undertakings specified in section 2 (1) numbers 3 to 8, with a credit institution in
another member state of the European Union or with a branch in Germany of a
credit institution domiciled outside Germany,
(g) a savings agreement, and
(h) a lease agreement;

2

subject to sentence 2, in any other cases insofar as the following conditions are met:
(a) the agreement is in writing,
(b) the transactions in question are settled via an account held by the customer with
a credit institution within the meaning of section 1 (1) with the exception of the
undertakings specified in section 2 (1) numbers 3 to 8, with a credit institution in
another member state of the European Union or with a branch in Germany of a
credit institution domiciled outside Germany or via a credit institution domiciled in
a non-EEA state to which requirements equivalent to those in Directive
2005/60/EC apply,

127

Section 25i

(c) the product or the related transaction is not anonymous and enables section 3 (2)
sentence 1 number 3 of the Money Laundering Act to be applied in good time,
and
(d) the payments under the agreement or the related transaction cannot be made in
favour of a third party except in the event of death or impairment, if a certain age
limit is exceeded or in comparable cases;
3

subject to sentence 2, in the case of products or related transactions allowing
investment in financial assets or claims, such as insurance or any other contingent
claims, if over and above the conditions specified in number 3
(a) the payments under the product or the transaction can be made only in the long
term,
(b) the product or the transaction cannot be used as collateral, and
(c) it is not possible to make premature payments and apply buyback clauses during
the term of the agreement and the agreement cannot be terminated prematurely.

2

However, a low risk shall be deemed to exist in the cases specified in sentence 1 numbers 1
to 3 only if the following thresholds are not exceeded:
1

for agreements within the meaning of sentence 1 number 1 letters (a), (b), (d) and (f)
or for agreements within the meaning of sentence 1 numbers 2 and 3, payments
totalling €15,000,

2

for agreements within the meaning of sentence 1 number 1 letters (c), (e) and (h) or
for any other agreements involving the financing of assets or their use and in which
ownership of the asset is not transferred to the contracting party or the user until the
agreement is completed, payments totalling €15,000 per calendar year,

3

for savings agreements within the meaning of sentence 1 number 1 letter (g), €1,000
per calendar year in the case of periodic payments or €2,500 for a one-off payment.

(2) 1Subsection (1) shall not apply if an institution has information with regard to a specific
transaction or business relationship which indicates that the risk of money laundering or
terrorist financing is not low. 2Institutions shall record and store appropriate information
pursuant to section 8 of the Money Laundering Act which is necessary to demonstrate to
BaFin that the conditions for applying simplified due diligence are met.

128

Section 25j

Section 25j
Simplified identification procedure
1

Notwithstanding section 4 (1) of the Money Laundering Act, verification of the identity of the
contracting party and the economic beneficiary can also be completed without delay after an
account or a safe custody account has been opened. 2In this case, it must be ensured that
no funds can be withdrawn from the account or safe custody account before the verification
of identity has been completed. Where received funds are repaid, they may only be
dispensed to the depositor.
Section 25k
Enhanced due diligence
(1) 1Over and above section 6 of the Money Laundering Act, institutions must comply with
enhanced due diligence standards commensurate with a higher risk also in the settlement of
payment transactions as part of business relationships with correspondent institutions
domiciled in a non-EEA state and correspondent institutions domiciled in an EEA country
subject to an assessment by the institution as higher risk. 2Insofar as these business
relationships do not concern the settlement of payment transactions, this is without prejudice
to section 5 (2) number 1 of the Money Laundering Act. 3Section 3 (4) sentence 2 of the
Money Laundering Act shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(2) In the cases cited in subsection (1), institutions must
1

obtain sufficient publicly available information about the correspondent institution and
its business and management structure in order to be able to understand fully, both
before and during such a business relationship, the nature of the business operations
conducted by the correspondent institution and assess its reputation and controls for
combating money laundering and terrorist financing as well as the quality of its
supervision,

2

lay down and document the respective responsibilities of both institutions with regard
to compliance with the due diligence standards before establishing such a business
relationship,

3

ensure that, before such a business relationship is established by an agent acting on
the obligated party’s behalf, he/she obtains the approval of a superior at the
institution,

4

take measures to ensure that they do not establish or maintain a business
relationship with a credit institution of which it is known that its accounts are used by a
shell bank within the meaning of Article 3 (10) of Directive 2005/60/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the
use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing
(OJ L 309/15) as last amended by Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 13 November 2007 (OJ L 319/1), and

129

Section 25I

5

take measures to ensure that the correspondent institution does not permit
transactions via interim accounts//pass-through accounts.

(3) Notwithstanding section 3 (2) sentence 1 number 2 of the Money Laundering Act, the due
diligence pursuant to section 3 (1) numbers 1 and 3 of the Money Laundering Act shall apply
to obligated parties pursuant to section 2 (1) numbers 1 and 2 of the Money Laundering Act
when accepting cash irrespective of any thresholds specified in the Money Laundering Act or
in this Act, insofar as foreign currency dealing within the meaning of section 1 (1a) sentence
2 number 7 is not settled via a customer account opened with the obligated party and the
transaction involves a value of €2,500 or more.
(4) Factoring institutions within the meaning of section 1 (1a) sentence 2 number 9 shall take
appropriate measures to combat a perceptibly higher risk of money laundering when
accepting payments from debtors who were unknown when the master agreement was
concluded.
(5) 1If facts are known or assessments are received from national or international agencies
that combat money laundering and terrorist financing, which warrant the assumption that a
higher risk exists in additional cases, in particular in connection with compliance with due
diligence standards in a state, BaFin may order that an institution must monitor a transaction
or a business relationship more closely, in particular the origin of the transferred assets of a
customer domiciled in such a state which are used within the scope of the business
relationship or the transaction, and satisfy additional due diligence and organisational
obligations commensurate with the higher risk. 2Institutions shall record and store appropriate
information on the measures taken in accordance with section 8 of the Money Laundering
Act. 3Sentences 1 and 2 shall also apply to institutions and superordinated undertakings
pursuant to section 25l (1).
Section 25I
Group-wide compliance with due diligence standards
(1) 1The institutions and undertakings specified in section 25h (1), (3) and (4), as
superordinated undertakings, must develop group-wide internal safeguards pursuant to
section 9 of the Money Laundering Act and section 25h (1), (3) and (4) of this Act and must
ensure compliance with the due diligence standards pursuant to sections 3, 5 and 6 of the
Money Laundering Act and sections 25i and 25k of this Act as well as the record-keeping
obligation pursuant to section 8 of the Money Laundering Act with regard to their
subordinated undertakings and branches. 2The senior managers within the meaning of
section 1 (2) sentence 1 shall be responsible for the proper fulfilment of the duties pursuant
to sentence 1. 3Insofar as the measures to be taken pursuant to sentence 1 as part of
establishing or conducting business relationships or transactions are not permissible or
actually feasible in a non-EEA state in which the undertaking is domiciled pursuant to the
laws of that state, the superordinated undertaking or the parent undertaking must ensure that
a subordinated undertaking or branch does not establish or maintain any business
relationships or conduct any transactions in this non-EEA state. 4If a business relationship
130

Section 25m

already exists, the superordinated undertaking or the parent undertaking must ensure that
the subordinated undertaking or branch ends this relationship by termination of contract or in
some other way regardless of any other statutory or contractual provisions. 5If stricter
obligations apply in the foreign state in which a subordinated undertaking or branch is
domiciled, these stricter obligations must be fulfilled there.
(2) Financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies which are deemed to
be the superordinated undertaking pursuant to section 10a are obligated parties within the
meaning of section 2 (1) number 1 of the Money Laundering Act 2In this respect, they shall
also be subject to supervision by BaFin pursuant to section 16 (1) in conjunction with
subsection (2) number 2 of the Money Laundering Act.
Section 25m
Prohibited business
The following activities are prohibited:
1

2

the establishment or maintenance of a correspondent banking relationship or any
other business relationship with a shell bank within the meaning of Article 3 (10) of
Directive 2005/60/EC and
the setting-up and maintenance of accounts in the name of the institution or for thirdparty institutions which customers can operate independently to conduct their own
transactions; this is without prejudice to section 154 (1) of the Fiscal Code.
Section 25n
Due diligence and organisational duties in e-money business

(1) When issuing e-money within the meaning of the Payment Services Oversight Act, the
institution must comply with the duties of section 3 (1) numbers 1 and 4, section 4 (1) to (4),
section 7 (1) and (2) and section 8 of the Money Laundering Act.
(2) 1These duties need not be met if the e-money amount issued to the e-money bearer and
saved on an e-money carrier is 100 euro or less per calendar month and it is guaranteed that
1

the e-money issued cannot technically linked to the e-money of another e-money
holder or to the e-money of another issuer,

2

the duties listed in subsection (1) are met when the e-money issued is redeemed
against the issue of cash, unless the redemption of the e-money relates to a value of
20 euro or less or the redemption takes the form of a credit transfer to an account of
the e-money holder with a CRR credit institution or of an e-money institution pursuant
to section 1 (2a) of the Payment Services Oversight Act and

3

where the electronic money is issued on a rechargeable e-money carrier, the
maximum amount of 100 euro per calendar month named in sentence 1 cannot be
exceeded.

131

Section 26
2

For the threshold of sentence 1 it is immaterial whether the e-money holder acquires the emoney through one process or various processes provided there is evidence to suggest that
they are linked.
(3) 1Where e-money is issued via a rechargeable e-money carrier, the e-money issuer must
maintain files recording all e-money amounts that have been issued to an already identified
e-money holder and redeemed, citing the time and the issuing or redeeming bodies. 2Section
8 (2) to (4) of the Money Laundering Act shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(4) If facts are known that warrant the assumption that, when using an
e-money carrier, the e-money issued can be associated with the e-money of another emoney holder or with e-money of another issuer or if facts justify the assumption that, in
connection with other technically possible uses of this e-money carrier, its sale or the
involvement of certain acceptance points there is a heightened risk of money laundering, the
financing of terrorism or other criminal actions pursuant to section 25c (1), BaFin may, in
order to counteract these risks with suitable measures,
1

issue instructions to the management of the institution;

2

prohibit the institution from using this e-money carrier or order other suitable and
necessary technical changes to this e-money carrier,

3

oblige the institution to meet risk-commensurate duties pursuant to sections 3 to 9 of
the Money Laundering Act.

(5) Where the use of an e-money carrier involves a small risk of money laundering, financing
of terrorism or other criminal actions pursuant to section 25h (1), BaFin may, subject to the
proviso that this can be revoked at any time, allow the institution to meet simplified due
diligence duties pursuant to section 5 of the Money Laundering Act or absolve it from
meeting other duties.

If an institution is exempt pursuant to section 2a (1), the auditor shall check for the continued
existence of the conditions referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended. 4If an institution is exempt pursuant to section 2a (3), the auditor shall check for
the continued existence of the conditions referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 as last amended. 5If BaFin has issued provisions vis-à-vis the institution regarding
the content of the audit pursuant to section 30, these provisions must be taken into
consideration by the auditor. 6If unrealised reserves are included in the institution's liable
capital, the auditor, when auditing the annual accounts, shall likewise examine whether
section 10 (4a) to (4c) in the version in force up to 31 December 2013 was complied with
when ascertaining those reserves. 7In the case of a credit institution that was requested to
prepare a recovery plan pursuant to section 47 (1), the auditor shall likewise examine
whether the recovery plan meets the criteria pursuant to section 47 (1) sentence 2 and
pursuant to section 47a (1) to (3) and (4) sentences 2 and 4. 8The findings shall be included
in the audit report.
(1a) 1Subsection (1) shall apply with respect to the requirements pursuant to Article 4 (1), (2)
and (3) subparagraph 2, Article 9 (1) to (4) and Article 11 (1) to (10), (11) subparagraph 1
and (12) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for the auditing of the annual accounts of central
counterparties subject to the proviso that the auditor shall additionally have to examine
whether the requirements pursuant to Article 7 (1) to (4), Article 8 (1) to (4) and Articles 26,
29, 33 to 54 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and the regulatory technical standards adopted
in accordance with these articles are complied with. 2Sentence 1 shall apply mutatis
mutandis for the condensed set of accounts of a central counterparty if such accounts must
be prepared pursuant to statutory requirements.
(2) 1The auditor shall also examine whether the institution has fulfilled its obligations pursuant
to sections 24c and 25h to 25n, the Money Laundering Act and Regulation (EC)
No 1781/2006; in the case of credit institutions, the auditor shall also examine whether the
credit institution has fulfilled its obligations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 and
Regulation (EU) No 260/2012. 2Furthermore, he/she shall examine compliance with the
notification and publication requirements and other requirements contained in Articles 5 to 10
and 12 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 14 March 2012 regarding short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps (OJ EU
136

Section 29
L 86/1 of 24 March 2012). 2In the case of institutions, branches within the meaning of
section 53b and branches within the meaning of section 53 which conduct safe custody
business, he/she shall audit that business particularly carefully unless it is to be audited
pursuant to section 36 (1) sentence 2 of the Securities Trading Act; this audit must also cover
compliance with section 128 of the Companies Act on disclosure requirements and section
135 of the Companies Act on the exercising of voting rights. 4The auditor shall report
separately on the items mentioned in sentences 1 to 3, respectively; section 26 (1) sentence
3 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(3) 1If, in the course of his/her audit, the auditor becomes aware of facts which might warrant
the qualification or withholding of the audit certificate, jeopardise the existence of the
institution or fundamentally impair its development, which constitute a material infringement
of the provisions on the institution’s approval requirements or the pursuit of business under
this Act, or which indicate that the senior managers have seriously infringed the law, the
articles of association, articles of incorporation or the partnership agreement, he/she shall
notify BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank without delay. 2At the request of BaFin or the
Deutsche Bundesbank, the auditor shall explain the audit report to them, and inform them of
any other facts which have come to his/her attention in the course of the audit which suggest
that the business of the institution is not being conducted properly. 3The notification,
explanatory and disclosure requirements pursuant to sentences 1 and 2 shall also apply in
relation to an undertaking which is closely linked to the institution if the auditor becomes
aware of the relevant facts while auditing the institution. 4The auditor shall not be liable for
the accuracy of facts which he/she reports in good faith pursuant to this subsection.
(4) 1The Federal Ministry of Finance is authorised, in agreement with the Federal Ministry of
Justice and after consulting the Deutsche Bundesbank, to issue by way of a statutory order
more detailed provisions on
1

the object of the audit pursuant to subsections (1) and (2),

2

the time at which it is carried out and

3

the contents of the audit reports

insofar as this is necessary for the performance of BaFin's functions, and especially in order
to enable it to identify irregularities which may jeopardise the safety of the assets entrusted to
the institution or which may impair the proper conduct of banking business or provision of
financial services, and to obtain consistent records for assessing the business conducted by
institutions. 2The statutory order may stipulate that the requirements set out in subsections
(1) to (3) shall also be complied with when auditing the consolidated accounts of a group of
institutions, financial holding group or mixed financial holding group or a financial
conglomerate; more detailed provisions on the object of the audit, the time at which it is to be
carried out and the contents of the audit report may be issued pursuant to sentence 1. 3The
Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory order.

Section 30

Section 30
Definition of audit content
1

Without prejudice to the special duties of the auditor pursuant to section 29, BaFin can also
issue provisions vis-à-vis the institution regarding the content of the audit, which must be
taken into consideration by the auditor when auditing the annual accounts. 2In particular,
BaFin can determine areas of emphasis for the audits.

said trading systems;
2

facts are known which reveal that an applicant or one of the persons specified in
section 1 (2) sentence 1 is not trustworthy;

3

facts are known which warrant the assumption that the holder of a major participating
interest or, if this is a legal person, a legal representative or representative pursuant
to the articles of association or articles of incorporation or, in the case of a commercial
partnership, a partner is not trustworthy or, for other reasons, fails to satisfy the
requirements to be set in the interests of the sound and prudent management of the
institution;

4

facts are known which reveal that the proprietor or one of the persons specified in
section 1 (2) sentence 1 does not have the professional qualifications required to

(EU) No 575/2013 or of a mixed financial holding company within the meaning of
Article 4 (1) number 32 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and facts are known which
warrant the assumption that a person within the meaning of section 2d is not
trustworthy or does not have the professional qualifications required to manage the
business of the financial holding company or of the mixed financial holding company;

5

a credit institution or a financial services institution which, in providing financial
services, is authorised to obtain ownership or possession of funds or securities of
customers or which, in accordance with an attestation from BaFin pursuant to section
4 (1) number 2 of the Act Governing the Certification of Old-Age Pension Contracts
(Gesetz über die Zertifizierung von Altersvorsorgeverträgen), is authorised to offer

7

the institution is not prepared or in a position to make the organisational

An investment adviser or investment broker who, in providing financial services, is not
authorised to obtain ownership or possession of funds or securities of customers and who
does not trade in financial instruments for his/her own account shall not be refused
authorisation pursuant to sentence 1 letter (a) if, instead of the initial capital, he/she can
demonstrate that, for the protection of customers, he/she has taken out appropriate
insurance with an indemnity of at least €1,000,000 for each insured loss and at least
€1,500,000 for all insured losses in an insurance year. 3Sentence 2 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to investment advisers and investment brokers who are also entered in a register
as insurance intermediaries pursuant to Directive 2002/92/EC and fulfil the requirements of
Article 4 (3) of Directive 2002/92/EC subject to the proviso that an indemnity of at least
€500,000 for each insured loss and at least €750,000 for all insured losses in an insurance
year is envisaged.
(2) 1BaFin may refuse authorisation if facts are known which warrant the assumption that
effective supervision of the institution is impaired. 2This is especially the case if
1

the institution is integrated in a corporate network with other individuals or
undertakings or is closely linked to such a network which, owing to the structure of
cross-shareholdings or because of inadequate economic transparency, impairs the
effective supervision of the institution;

2

effective supervision of the institution is impaired by the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions of a non-EEA state applicable to such individuals or
undertakings;

3

the institution is a subsidiary of an institution domiciled in a non-EEA state that is not
effectively supervised in the state in which it has its domicile or head office, or whose
competent supervisory agency is not willing to cooperate satisfactorily with BaFin;

3

BaFin may also refuse to grant authorisation if, contrary to section 32 (1) sentence 2, the
application contains insufficient data or documentation.
(3) Authorisation may not be refused for reasons other than those specified in subsections
(1) and (3).
(4) 1BaFin must inform the applicant whether authorisation will be granted or refused within
six months of the applicant having submitted the complete documentation required for an
144

Section 33a
application for authorisation pursuant to section 32 (1) sentence 2. 2The application will be
rejected if BaFin, within twelve months of it receiving the application, does not have sufficient
information or documentation for it to make a decision on the application, despite having
issued a deadline of one month for the application to be completed.
Section 33a
Deferral or restriction of authorisation in the case of undertakings domiciled outside
the European Union
1

BaFin must defer the decision on an application for authorisation by undertakings domiciled
outside the European Union or by subsidiaries of such undertakings, or must limit the
authorisation, if a decision to this effect has been taken by the Council or the European
Commission pursuant to Article 147 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 1The deferral or limitation may
not exceed three months from the date of the decision. 3Sentences 1 and 2 shall also apply
to applications for authorisation submitted after the date of the decision. 4If the Council of the
European Union decides to prolong the period pursuant to sentence 2, BaFin must take due
account of this prolongation and prolong the deferral or limitation accordingly.
Section 33b
Consultation of the competent agencies of another EEA state
1

If authorisation is to be granted to conduct banking business pursuant to section 1 (1)
sentence 2 number 1, 2, 4, or 10 or to provide financial services pursuant to section 1 (1a)
sentence 2 numbers 1 to 4 to an undertaking which
1

is a subsidiary or an affiliated undertaking of a CRR institution or a primary insurance
company and whose parent undertaking is authorised to operate in another EEA
state, or

2

is controlled by the same natural persons or undertakings which control a CRR
institution or a primary insurance company domiciled in another EEA state,

BaFin will consult the competent agencies in the home member state before granting
authorisation. 2The consultation will include, in particular, the information required to assess
the trustworthiness and professional qualifications of the persons specified in section 1 (2)
sentence 1 as well as to assess the trustworthiness of the holders of a major participating
interest in undertakings of the same group domiciled in the EEA state in question.
Section 34
Representation and continuation of business in the event of death
(1) Section 45 of the Industrial Code (Gewerbeordnung) shall not apply to institutions.
(2) 1In the event of the death of the holder of authorisation, an institution's business may be
continued on behalf of the heirs by two representatives without authorisation for a period of
up to one year. 2The representatives shall be designated without delay following the death of
145

Section 35
the holder of authorisation; they shall be deemed to be senior managers. 3If a representative
is not trustworthy or does not have the necessary professional qualifications, BaFin can
prohibit the continuation of business. 4BaFin can prolong the period pursuant to sentence 1 if
there are special reasons for doing so. 5One representative shall be sufficient in the case of
financial services institutions which, in providing financial services, are not authorised to
obtain ownership or possession of funds or securities of customers.
Section 35
Expiry and revocation of authorisation
(1) 1Authorisation shall expire if it is not used within one year from the date on which it is
granted. 2Authorisation shall likewise expire if the institution has been excluded from the
compensation scheme pursuant to section 11 of the Deposit Guarantee and Investor
Compensation Act. 3Authorisation to conduct banking business within the meaning of section
1 sentence 2 number 12 shall likewise expire if the authorisation of the central counterparty
pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on the provision of clearing services
has been rejected by BaFin and the rejection is final and absolute.
(2) BaFin may revoke authorisation pursuant to the provisions of the Act on Administrative
Procedures, and also if
1

the business operations to which the authorisation relates have not been conducted
for more than six months;

2

a credit institution is operated in the legal form of a sole proprietorship;

3

it becomes aware of facts which would warrant refusal of authorisation pursuant to
section 33 (1) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 8 or (2) numbers 1 to 3;

4

the discharge of an institution's obligations to its creditors, and particularly the safety
of the assets entrusted to it, is endangered, and the danger cannot be averted by
taking other measures under this Act; the safety of the assets entrusted to the
institution is endangered, inter alia, by
(a) a loss amounting to half of its liable capital pursuant to Article 72 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as last amended, or
(b) a loss amounting to more than 10 per cent of its liable capital pursuant to Article
72 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended in each of at least three
successive financial years;

5

(repealed)

6

the institution has persistently contravened provisions of this Act, the Money
Laundering Act, the Securities Trading Act or the regulations or orders issued to
implement these Acts;

7

(repealed)

146

Section 36

8

the prudential requirements in Articles 92 to 403 as well as 411 to 428 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 are no longer fulfilled.

(2a) 1The authorisation will be revoked by BaFin if insolvency proceedings are initiated in
respect of the institution or a dissolution order has been issued. 2The revocation of the
authorisation shall not hinder the persons responsible for the liquidation from continuing to
carry out certain activities of the institution, provided these are necessary or advisable for the
purposes of the insolvency or liquidation proceedings.
(3) Section 48 (4) sentence 1 and section 49 (2) sentence 2 of the Act on Administrative
Procedures concerning the period of one year shall not apply.
(4) If an institution's authorisation to conduct banking business or provide financial services is
revoked, BaFin will inform without delay the competent agencies of the other EEA states in
which the institution has established branches or has been providing cross-border services.
Section 36
Removal of senior managers or members of the supervisory body
(1) 1In the cases specified in section 35 (2) numbers 3, 4, and 6, BaFin, instead of revoking
authorisation, may demand the removal of the senior managers responsible and may also
prohibit these senior managers from carrying out their activities at institutions organised in
the form of a legal person. 2For the purposes of sentence 1, section 35 (2) number 4 shall
apply subject to the proviso that, when calculating the amount of the loss, accounting
conveniences used to reduce or avoid a balance sheet loss are disregarded.
(1a) 1In the cases specified in Article 20 (1) letters (b) to (d) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
BaFin, instead of revoking authorisation, may demand the removal of the senior managers
responsible and may also prohibit these senior managers from carrying out their activities at
institutions organised in the form of a legal person. 2BaFin can also demand removal if the
requirements of Article 27 (1) of Regulation No 648/2012 are not fulfilled or the requirements
of Article 31 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are fulfilled.
(2) BaFin may also demand the removal of a senior manager and prohibit that senior
manager from carrying out his/her activities at institutions organised in the form of a legal
person if he/she has intentionally or recklessly contravened the provisions of this Act,
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the Act on Building and Loan
Associations, the Safe Custody Act (Depotgesetz), the Money Laundering Act, the Capital
Investment Code, the Pfandbrief Act, the Payment Services Oversight Act or the Securities

implement Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the legal acts adopted to
implement Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, or orders issued by BaFin and he/she persists in
such behaviour despite having been duly warned by BaFin.
(3) 1BaFin can demand the removal of a person specified in section 25d (3) sentences 1 and
2 and section 25d (3a) sentence 1 from the undertakings specified in section 25d (3)
147

Section 36

sentences 1 and 2 and section 25d (3a) sentence 1 and prohibit such a person from carrying
out his/her activities, if
1

facts are known which reveal that the person is not trustworthy;

2

facts are known which reveal that the person lacks the necessary expertise;

3

facts are known which reveal that the person does not devote sufficient time to
carrying out his/her tasks;

4

the person was kept unaware of serious violations of the principles of proper
management by his or her institution due to careless exercise of its oversight and
control function and such behaviour persists despite due warning by BaFin;

5

the person did not do everything needed to counter detected infringements and
continues to refrain from doing so despite due warning by BaFin;

6

the person specified by section 25d (3) sentence 1 or sentence 2 is already a senior
manager of the same undertaking;

7

the person specified by section 25d (3) sentence 1 or sentence 2 was a senior
manager of the same undertaking and two former senior managers of the undertaking

8

the person specified by section 25d (3) sentence 1 or sentence 2 exercises more than
four controlling mandates and BaFin has not authorised him/her to exercise additional

controlling mandates at institutions under BaFin's supervision.

2

For institutions that are subject to separate legal supervision on account of their legal form,
a measure pursuant to sentence 1 shall only take place following consultation with the
authority responsible for the legal supervision of such institutions. 3Where the court has, at
the request of the supervisory body, been called upon to remove a member of that body, the
relevant application may, provided that the requirements of sentence 1 numbers 1 to 9 have
been met, also be submitted by BaFin if the supervisory board has failed to act on the
removal instruction issued by the Supervisory Authority. 4The removal of employee
representatives in the supervisory body shall take place solely in accordance with the
provisions of the laws on co-determination (Mitbestimmungsgesetze).

148

Section 37

Section 37
Intervention against unauthorised or prohibited business
(1) 1If banking business is carried out or financial services are provided without the
authorisation required under section 32, if clearing services are carried out without the
authorisation as a central counterparty required by Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, or if business prohibited under section 3 is conducted, BaFin can order the
undertaking and the members of its governing bodies to cease business operations
immediately and to settle this business without delay. 2It may issue instructions for the
settlement of the business and appoint a suitable person as the liquidator. 3It may publicise
its measures pursuant to sentences 1 and 2. 4BaFin’s powers pursuant to sentences 1 to 3
shall also apply vis-à-vis the undertaking involved in the initiation, conclusion or settlement of
such business.
(2) The liquidator shall be authorised to file a petition for the initiation of insolvency
proceedings over the undertaking's assets.
(3) 1The liquidator shall receive appropriate remuneration and reimbursement of his/her
expenses from BaFin. 2The amounts paid shall be refunded separately to BaFin by the
undertaking and, at BaFin’s request, shall be provided in advance. 3BaFin can instruct the
undertaking concerned to pay the amount laid down by BaFin directly to the liquidator on
BaFin’s behalf if there is no reason to suspect that this may affect the liquidator's
independence.
Section 38
Consequences of the revocation and expiry of authorisation; measures in the event of
liquidation
(1) 1If BaFin revokes authorisation or if authorisation expires, in the case of legal persons and
commercial partnerships it may decide that the institution is to be liquidated. 2BaFin’s
decision shall have the effect of a dissolution order. 3The court of registration shall be
informed of the decision and shall enter it accordingly in the commercial register or register of
cooperative societies (Genossenschaftsregister).
(2) 1BaFin may issue instructions regarding the liquidation of an institution or its banking
business and financial services. 2The court shall appoint liquidators at BaFin’s request if the
persons otherwise appointed to liquidate the banking business and financial services offer no
guarantee of proper liquidation. 3If responsibility therefor does not lie with the court, BaFin
will appoint the liquidator.
(2a) 1The liquidator shall receive appropriate remuneration and reimbursement of his/her
expenses from BaFin. 2The amounts paid shall be refunded separately to BaFin by the legal
person or commercial partnership concerned and, at BaFin’s request, shall be provided in
advance. 3BaFin can instruct the legal person or commercial partnership concerned to pay
the amount laid down by BaFin directly to the liquidator on BaFin’s behalf if there is no
reason to suspect that this may affect the liquidator's independence.
149

Section 39
(3) 1BaFin will publicise the revocation or expiry of authorisation in the Federal Gazette. 2It
will inform the competent agencies of the other EEA states in which the institution has
established branches or has been providing cross-border services.
(4) Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply to legal persons governed by public law.

Division 2 PROTECTED TERMS
Section 39
The terms "bank" and "banker"
(1) The terms “bank” (“Bank”) or “banker” (“Bankier”) or a term in which the words “bank” or
“banker” appear, unless otherwise stipulated by law, may be used in the corporate name, as
an addendum to the corporate name, to describe the business purpose or for advertising
purposes only by
1

credit institutions with authorisation pursuant to section 32 or branches of
undertakings pursuant to section 53b (1) sentences 1 and 2 or (7);

2

other undertakings which, upon this Act coming into force, were legitimately using
such a term pursuant to previous provisions;

(2) The term “people's bank” (“Volksbank”) or a term in which the words “people's bank”
appear may be newly taken up only by credit institutions operating in the legal form of a
registered cooperative society and belonging to an audit association.
(3) When granting authorisation, BaFin may decide that the terms specified in subsection (1)
may not be used if, according to generally accepted standards, the nature or volume of the
business conducted by the credit institution does not warrant the use of such a term.
Section 40
The term “savings bank”
(1) The term “savings bank” (“Sparkasse”) or a term in which the words “savings bank”
appear may be used in the corporate name, as an addendum to the corporate name, to
describe the business purpose or for advertising purposes only by
1

public savings banks with authorisation pursuant to section 32;

2

other undertakings which, upon this Act coming into force, were legitimately using
such a term pursuant to previous provisions;

3

undertakings which are newly established by restructuring the undertakings specified
in number 2 as long as they, by virtue of their articles of association or articles of
incorporation, exhibit specific features (in particular, tasks geared towards public

150

Section 41

welfare and a restriction of their principal business operations to the economic area in
which the undertaking is domiciled) to the same extent as before restructuring.
(2) Credit institutions within the meaning of section 1 of the Act on Building and Loan
Associations may use the term “building and loan association” (“Bausparkasse”); registered
cooperative societies which belong to an audit association may use the term “savings and
loans bank” (“Spar- und Darlehenskasse”).
Section 41
Exceptions
1

Sections 39 and 40 shall not apply to undertakings that use the words “bank”, “banker” or
“savings bank” in a context which precludes the impression that they conduct banking
business. 2Credit institutions domiciled outside Germany may use the terms specified in
section 39 (2) and section 40 in their corporate name, as an addendum to their corporate
name, to describe their business purpose or for advertising purposes for their operations in
Germany if they are entitled to use these terms in their country of domicile and append an
addendum to the term referring to their country of domicile.
Section 42
BaFin’s decision
1

In cases of doubt, BaFin will decide whether an undertaking is authorised to use the terms
specified in sections 39 and 40. 2It will inform the court of registration of its decisions.
Section 43
Registration provisions
(1) If authorisation is required to conduct banking business or provide financial services
pursuant to section 32, entries in public registers may be made only if the court of registration
has been furnished with evidence of such authorisation.
(2) 1If an undertaking uses a corporate name or an addendum to a corporate name which is
impermissible pursuant to sections 39 to 41, the court of registration shall compel the
undertaking to refrain from using the corporate name or addendum to the corporate name by
imposing an administrative fine; section 392 of the Act on the Procedure in Cases Involving
Family Law and on Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction (Gesetz über das Verfahren in
Familiensachen und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit) shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 2This is without prejudice to section 395 of the Act on the Procedure in
Cases Involving Family Law and on Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction.
(3) BaFin shall be entitled to file petitions in proceedings before the court of registration
regarding the entry or amendment of the legal relationships or corporate name of credit
institutions or undertakings using terms that are impermissible pursuant to sections 39 to 41,

151

Section 44

and may also seek the legal remedies permissible under the Act on the Procedure in Cases
Involving Family Law and on Matters of Non-Contentious Jurisdiction.

Division 3 INFORMATION AND INSPECTIONS
Section 44
Information from and inspections of institutions, ancillary service providers, financial
holding companies, mixed financial holding companies and undertakings included in
supervision on a consolidated basis
(1) 1An institution or a superordinated undertaking, the members of its governing bodies and
its employees shall, upon request, provide BaFin, the persons and entities which BaFin uses
in performing its functions and the Deutsche Bundesbank with information about all business
activities, documentation and, if necessary, copies. 2BaFin may perform inspections at the
institutions and superordinated undertakings, with or without a special reason, and may
entrust the Deutsche Bundesbank with the task of carrying out such inspections; this shall
include undertakings to which an institution or superordinated undertaking has outsourced
major areas within the meaning of section 25b (external service providers). 3BaFin’s staff, the
staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank as well as any other persons whom BaFin uses to perform
the inspections may enter and inspect the business premises of the institution, the external
service provider and the superordinated undertaking for this purpose during ordinary office
and business hours. 4The parties affected shall acquiesce to the measures taken under
sentences 2 and 3.
(1a) If a central counterparty outsources operational functions, services or activities to an
undertaking in accordance with the requirements of Article 35 (1) of Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, BaFin's powers pursuant to subsection (1) sentences 2 and 3 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to these undertakings; subsection (1) sentence 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(2) 1A subordinated undertaking within the meaning of section 10a, a financial holding
company at the head of a financial holding group within the meaning of section 10a, a mixed
financial holding company at the head of a mixed financial holding group within the meaning
of section 10a or a mixed holding company and a member of a governing body of such an
undertaking shall, upon request, provide information, documentation and, if necessary,
copies to BaFin, the persons and agencies which BaFin uses in performing its functions and
the Deutsche Bundesbank, in order to enable them to check the accuracy of the information
or data supplied and which are required for supervision on a consolidated basis or which are
to be supplied in connection with a statutory order pursuant to section 25 (3) sentence 1.
2
BaFin may perform inspections at the undertakings specified in sentence 1, with or without a
special reason, and may entrust the Deutsche Bundesbank with the task of carrying out such
inspections; subsection (1) sentence 2 clause 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3BaFin’s staff,
the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank as well as any other persons whom BaFin uses to
perform the inspections may enter and inspect the undertakings’ business premises for this

152

Section 44
purpose during ordinary office and business hours. 4The parties affected shall acquiesce to
the measures taken under sentences 2 and 3. 5Sentences 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to a subsidiary not included in the consolidation and to a mixed holding company
and its subsidiaries.
(2a) 1If, in the supervision of a group of institutions, a financial holding group, a mixed
financial holding group or a mixed holding group, BaFin requires information which has
already been submitted to another competent agency, it will initially address its request for
information to this competent agency. 2When supervising institutions which are subordinated
to an EU parent institution pursuant to section 10a, BaFin addresses, as a matter of routine,
its initial requests for information on the implementation of the approaches and measures
under Directive 2013/36/EU to the agency responsible for consolidated supervision.
(3) 1Undertakings domiciled outside Germany which are included in the consolidation must,
upon request, allow BaFin to carry out the inspections permitted under this Act, in particular
checks of the accuracy of the data supplied for the consolidation pursuant to section 10a (4)
to (7), section 25 (2) and (3) and Articles 11 to 17 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended, insofar as this is both necessary to enable BaFin to perform its functions and
permissible under the laws of the other state. 2This shall also apply to subsidiaries domiciled
outside Germany which are not included in the consolidation.
(3a) (Repealed)
(4) 1BaFin can send representatives to shareholders' meetings, general meetings or partners'
meetings, as well as to meetings of the supervisory bodies of institutions, financial holding
companies or mixed financial holding companies organised in the form of a legal person.
2
They may address these meetings. 3The parties affected shall acquiesce to the measures
taken under sentences 1 and 2.
(5) 1Institutions, financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies
organised in the form of a legal person shall, at BaFin’s request, call the meetings specified
in subsection (4) sentence 1, call meetings of the supervisory bodies and announce subjects
on which decisions are to be taken. 2BaFin can send representatives to a meeting called
pursuant to sentence 1. 3They may address the meeting. 4The parties affected shall
acquiesce to the measures taken under sentences 2 and 3. 5This is without prejudice to
section 4.
(6) A person obliged to furnish information may refuse to do so in respect of any questions,
the answers to which would place him/her or one of his/her relatives as designated in section
383 (1) numbers 1 to 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure at risk of criminal prosecution or
proceedings under the Act on Breaches of Administrative Regulations (Gesetz über
Ordnungswidrigkeiten).

153

Section 44a

Section 44a
Cross-border information and audits
(1) 1Legislation that hinders the transmission of data shall not apply to the transmission of
data between an institution, a German asset management company, a financial undertaking,
a financial holding company, a mixed financial holding company, an ancillary service
provider, an e-money institution within the meaning of the Payment Services Oversight Act, a
payment institution within the meaning of the Payment Services Oversight Act, or an
undertaking domiciled outside Germany which directly or indirectly holds at least 20 per cent
of the capital shares or voting rights in the undertaking, is a parent undertaking or can
exercise a controlling influence, or between a mixed-activity holding company and its
subsidiaries domiciled outside Germany, if such transmission of data is necessary to comply
with the prudential provisions pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC for
the undertaking domiciled outside Germany. 2BaFin can prohibit an institution from
transmitting data to a non-EEA state.
(2) 1At the request of an agency responsible for the supervision of an undertaking domiciled
in another EEA state, BaFin will check the accuracy of the data transmitted by an
undertaking within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 for that supervisory body
pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or Directive 2002/87/EC, or
shall permit the agency making the request, an external auditor or an expert to check such
data; BaFin may, at its own diligent discretion, adopt the same procedure vis-à-vis
supervisory bodies in non-EEA states provided that reciprocity is assured. 2Section 5 (2) of
the Act on Administrative Procedures regarding the limits to administrative assistance shall
apply mutatis mutandis. 3The undertakings within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1
shall acquiesce to the checks.
(3) 1BaFin can request from CRR credit institutions, securities trading firms, German asset
management companies, financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies
domiciled in another EEA state that it be given information that facilitates the supervision of
institutions which are subsidiaries of these undertakings and which are not included in
supervision on a consolidated basis by the competent agencies of the other state for reasons
corresponding to those specified in Article 19 (1) or (2) letter (b) of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013.
Section 44b
Information from and inspections of the holders of major participating interests
(1) 1The obligations vis-à-vis BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank to provide information
and present documentation pursuant to section 44 (1) sentence 1 shall also apply to
1

persons and undertakings who report the intention to acquire a participating interest
pursuant to section 2c or who are named as holders of major participating interests in
connection with an application for authorisation pursuant to section 32 (1) sentence 2
number 6 or a supplementary report pursuant to section 64e (2) sentence 4,

154

Section 44c

2

the holders of a major participating interest in an institution and the undertakings
controlled by them,

3

persons and undertakings about whom facts are known which warrant the assumption
that they are persons or undertakings within the meaning of number 2, and

4

persons and undertakings who are associated with a person or an undertaking within
the meaning of numbers 1 to 3 pursuant to section 15 of the Companies Act.

2

At BaFin’s request, the party obliged to present documentation shall, at its own expense,
arrange for the documentation to be submitted pursuant to section 2c (1) sentence 2 to be
examined by an external auditor determined by BaFin.
(2) 1BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank may take measures pursuant to section 44 (1)
sentences 2 and 3 in respect of the persons and undertakings specified in subsection (1) if
there is evidence of grounds for a prohibition pursuant to section 2c (1b) sentence 1 numbers
1 to 6. 2The parties affected shall acquiesce to these measures.
(3) A person obliged to furnish information pursuant to subsections (1) or (2) may refuse to
do so in respect of any questions, the answers to which would place him/her or one of his/her
relatives as designated in section 383 (1) numbers 1 to 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure at
risk of criminal prosecution or proceedings under the Act on Breaches of Administrative
Regulations.
Section 44c
Prosecution of unauthorised banking business and financial services
(1) 1An undertaking about which facts are known which warrant the assumption that it
conducts banking business or provides financial services without the authorisation required
under this Act or without the authorisation required under Article 14 of Regulation (EU)
648/2012 or that it conducts business prohibited under section 3, a member of its governing
bodies, an employee of this undertaking as well as other undertakings which are or were
involved in performing such business shall, upon request, provide information about all of the
undertaking's business activities and submit documentation to BaFin and the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 2A member of a governing body and an employee shall, upon request, provide
information even after they have left the governing body or the undertaking.
(2) 1BaFin can carry out inspections on the premises of the undertaking as well as on the
premises of the persons and undertakings obliged to provide information and present
documentation pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 insofar as this is necessary to
determine the nature or volume of the business or activities, and it may entrust the Deutsche
Bundesbank with the task of carrying out such inspections. 2To this end, BaFin’s staff and the
staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank may enter and inspect these premises during ordinary
office and business hours. 3In order to prevent imminent risks to public order and safety, they
will be authorised to enter and inspect these premises also outside ordinary office and
business hours, and may enter and inspect premises which also serve as living

155

Section 44c

accommodation; the basic right enshrined in Article 13 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) shall
be limited in this respect.
(3) 1BaFin’s staff and the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank may search these premises of
the undertaking as well as those of the persons and undertakings obliged to provide
information and present documentation pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1. 2When
conducting the search the staff may also search the persons obliged to provide information
and documentation for the purposes of securing objects within the meaning of section 4.
3
The basic right enshrined in Article 13 of the Basic Law shall be limited in this respect.
4
Searches of business premises and persons shall require a judicial order except in the event
of imminent danger. 5Searches of premises which serve as living accommodation shall
require a judicial order. 6The court responsible shall be the local court (Amtsgericht) in whose
area of jurisdiction the premises are located. 7An appeal may be lodged against the judicial
decision; sections 306 to 310 and 311a of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 8A written record shall be made of the search. 9It must specify which
official agency was responsible for carrying out the search, the reason, time and place of the
search and its outcome and, if no judicial order was issued, the facts substantiating the
presumption of imminent danger.
(4) BaFin’s staff and the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank may seize items which could be
of importance as evidence in their investigations.
(5) 1The parties affected shall acquiesce to measures taken pursuant to subsection (2),
subsection (3) sentence 1 and subsection (4). 2Section 44 (6) shall apply.
(6) 1The rights of BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank as well as the duties to cooperate
and acquiesce incumbent upon the parties affected shall also apply to the undertakings and
persons about which facts are known which warrant the assumption that they are involved in
the initiation, conclusion or settlement of unauthorised banking business or financial services.
2
If the competent authority of another state makes an appropriate request to BaFin, the
aforementioned rights and duties shall also apply in respect of the undertakings and persons
about which facts are known which warrant the assumption that the undertakings or persons
are involved in the initiation, conclusion or settlement of banking business or financial
services, which are being conducted or provided in the other state contrary to a prohibition in
effect in that state.

Section 45

Division 4 MEASURES IN SPECIAL CASES
Section 45
Measures to improve the adequacy of own funds and liquidity
(1) 1If the assets and liabilities, financial position and profitability of an institution justifies the
assumption that it will not be able to sustainably fulfil the requirements of Articles 92 to 386 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended or of section 10 (3) and (4), section 45b (1)
sentence 2, section 11 or section 51a (1) or (2) or section 51b, BaFin may order the
institution to take measures to improve its own capital adequacy and liquidity, in particular
1

to produce a well-founded description of the development of the key business
activities over a period of at least three years, including projected balance sheets and
projected profit and loss accounts as well as of the development of the prudential
ratios and present said description to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank.

2

to review measures for improving protection against or reducing the major risks
identified by the institution and thus the associated risk concentrations and to report
this to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank; concepts for exiting from individual
business areas or severing parts of the institution or group should also be considered.

3

to report on suitable measures to increase the institution’s tier 1 capital, own funds
and liquidity to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank,

4

to develop a concept for averting a potentially dangerous situation within the meaning
of section 35 (2) number 4 and present said concept to BaFin and the Deutsche
Bundesbank.

2

The assumption that the institution will not be able to sustainably fulfil the requirements of
Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended or section 10 (3) and (4),
section 45b (1) sentence 2, section 11 or section 51a (1) or (2) or section 51b is routinely
justified if
1

the total capital ratio for the ratio of own funds to the sum, multiplied by 12.5, of the
total capital charge for credit risk, the capital charge for operational risk and the sum
of the capital charges for market risk exposures including options trades pursuant to
Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended or the statutory
order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1 or the ratios pursuant to the statutory
order pursuant to section 51a (1) sentence 2, has decreased from one reporting date
to the next by at least 10%, or the liquidity ratio to be calculated in accordance with
the statutory order pursuant to section 11 (1) or in accordance with the statutory order
pursuant to section 51b (2) sentence 1 has decreased from one reporting date to the
next by at least 25% and it can be expected on the basis of this development that the
minimum requirements will be undershot within the next 12 months, or

2

The total capital ratio for the ratio of own funds to the sum, multiplied by 12.5, of the
total capital charge for credit risk, the capital charge for operational risk and the sum
of the capital charges for market risk exposures including options trades pursuant to
157

Section 45

Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended or the statutory
order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 1 or the ratios pursuant to the statutory
order pursuant to section 51a (1) sentence 2, has decreased on at least three
successive reporting dates by more than 3% in each case, or the liquidity ratio to be
calculated in accordance with the statutory order pursuant to section 11 (1) or in
accordance with the statutory order pursuant to section 51b (2) sentence 1 has
decreased on at least three successive reporting dates by more than 10% in each
case and it can be expected on the basis of this development that the minimum
requirements will be undershot within the next 18 months and no facts are apparent
which justify the assumption that it is highly likely that the minimum requirements will
not be undershot.
3

In conjunction with or in place of the measures pursuant to sentence 1, BaFin may also
order the adoption of measures pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 7 if the
measures pursuant to sentence 1 do not provide sufficient assurance of sustainably ensuring
compliance with the requirements of Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as
last amended or section 10 (3) and (4), section 45b (1) sentence 2, section 11 or section 51a
(1) or (2) or section 51b; subsection (5) is thus to be applied accordingly.
(2) 1If an institution’s own funds do not meet the requirements laid down in Articles 24 to 386
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended, section 10 (3) and (4) or section 45b (1)
sentence 2 or if the investment of its funds does not meet the requirements laid down in
section 11 or if the liable capital of a housing undertaking with a savings facility does not
meet the requirements laid down in section 51a (1) and (2) or section 45b (1) sentence 2 or
the investment of its funds does not meet the requirements laid down in section 51b, BaFin
can
1

prohibit or limit both withdrawals by the proprietors or partners and the distribution of
profits,

2

prohibit or limit balance sheet measures that serve to offset an existing annual loss or
to show a balance sheet profit;

3

order that the distribution of all types of profit-related disbursements on own funds
instruments be dispensed with fully or in part and without replacement if they are not
fully covered by an existing annual profit;

4

prohibit or limit lending within the meaning of section 19 (1);

5

order the institution to take measures to reduce risks insofar as they arise from certain
types of activities and products or through the use of certain systems;

5a

order the institution to limit the total annual amount designated for the variable
remuneration of all senior managers and employees (total amount of variable
remuneration) to a certain proportion of the profit for the year or to completely cancel
it; this does not apply to variable components of remuneration established in a
collective wage agreement or within its scope of application through an agreement of
the contracting parties on the application of the provisions of the collective wage
158

Section 45

agreement or on the basis of a collective wage agreement in a plant-level or service
agreement;
6

prohibit or limit variable components of remuneration to a certain proportion of the
profit for the year; this does not apply to variable components of remuneration
established in a collective wage agreement or within its scope of application through
an agreement of the contracting parties on the application of the provisions of the
collective wage agreement or on the basis of a collective wage agreement in a plantlevel or service agreement;

7

order that the institution describe how and it what period of time the adequacy of own
funds or liquidity of the institution is to be sustainably restored (restructuring plan) and
that BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank are regularly informed of the progress of
these measures, and

8

order that the institution implement one or more options from a resolution plan
pursuant to section 47a.

2

The restructuring plan pursuant to subsection (1) number 7 must be transparent, plausible
and justified. 3For the implementation of the measures described, the plan must name
concrete aims, interim targets and deadlines that can be monitored by BaFin. 4BaFin can, at
any time, inspect the restructuring plan and the associated documents. 5BaFin can demand
that the restructuring plan be amended and impose specifications in this regard if it considers
the stated objectives, interim target and implementation deadlines to be insufficient or if the
institution does not adhere to them.
(3) 1Subsections (1) and (2) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to superordinated undertakings within the meaning of section 10a as well as
institutions that are required to sub-consolidate pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 if the consolidated own funds of the undertakings belonging to the group do not
meet the requirements laid down in Articles 24 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as
last amended or section 45b (1). 2In the case of an institution belonging to the group making
use of the exemption pursuant to section 2a (1), BaFin can, on a temporary basis, partly or
fully postpone the application of this exemption with regard to the provisions of Articles 24 to
403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended.
(4) (Repealed)
(5) 1BaFin may issue the orders specified in subsections (2) and (3) only if the institution or
the mixed financial holding company has failed to remedy the deficiency within a period set
by BaFin. 2If this is required to prevent a foreseeable short-term deterioration in the
adequacy of own funds or the liquidity of the institution or if measures pursuant to subsection
(1) sentence 1 have already been taken, such orders are permissible even without prior
warning with the setting of a deadline. 2Decisions on the distribution of profits shall be void
insofar as they contradict an order issued pursuant to subsections (2) and (3). 4If provisions
in contracts on own funds instruments contradict an order issued pursuant to subsections (2)
and (3), no rights can be derived from them. 5At the same time as or subsequent to
159

Section 45

prohibiting the payment of variable components of remuneration pursuant to subsection (2)
sentence 1 number 6, BaFin can order that entitlements to confer variable remuneration
components are rendered completely or partly invalid if
1

the institution, at the time that the payment is prohibited or within a period of two
years thereafter, makes use of exceptional government intervention, including
measures from the Restructuring Fund Act or the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund
Act, and the preconditions for the prohibition of the payment have, by this point in
time, not ceased to apply, or have done so only on the basis of said measures,

2

an order by BaFin pursuant to subsection (2) numbers 1 to 7 is issued or already
exists at the time the payment is prohibited or within a period of two years thereafter,
or

3

measures pursuant to section 46 or pursuant to section 48a are taken at the time the
payment is prohibited or within a period of two years thereafter.

6

Such an order may be also issued, in particular, if
1

the entitlements to grant variable remuneration were created on the basis of
provisions of an institution's remuneration system which contradict the prudential
requirements of this law for suitable and transparent remuneration systems geared
towards the institution’s sustainable development, or

2

it is to be assumed that without the granting of financial assistance by the
Restructuring Fund or the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund the institution would not
have been in a position to grant the variable remuneration components; if it is to be
assumed that the institution would have been able to grant some of the variable
remuneration components, the variable remuneration components are to be cut
commensurately.

7

BaFin can also issue orders pursuant to sentence 5 and pursuant to subsection (2)
sentence 1 numbers 5a and 6 if an institution makes use of exceptional government
intervention, including measures from the Restructuring Fund Act or the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund Act, and it appears necessary to issue an order for the institution to
maintain a sound capital base or sound liquidity and for the early termination of government
assistance. 8If an institution makes use of government assistance, BaFin can also completely
or partially prohibit the payment of variable remuneration components to members of the
governing bodies and senior managers of the institution and order the revocation of
corresponding entitlements; such an order shall not be issued if the payment or the
maintenance of the entitlements is justified in spite of the conditions for the prohibition being
met and the existence of circumstances specified in sentence 6. 9Sentences 5 to7 do not
apply if the entitlements to grant variable remuneration came into existence before 1 January
2011. 10Sentence 8 does not apply if the entitlements to grant variable remuneration came
into existence before 1 January 2012. 11Institutions must take account of the power to issue
orders pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 numbers 5a and 6 and the provisions in
sentences 5 to 8 in corresponding contractual agreements with members of their governing
160

Section 45a
bodies and their senior management and staff members. 12If contractual agreements on the
granting of variable remuneration run counter to an order pursuant to subsection (2)
sentence 1 numbers 5a and 6 or the provisions in sentences 5 to 8, no rights can be derived
from them.
(6) BaFin can also order measures pursuant to subsections (1) to (5) if an institution, the
superordinated undertaking of a group of institutions, of a financial holding group or of a
mixed financial holding group does not comply with the increased capital requirements
ordered pursuant to section 10 (4).
(7) 1For the implementation of orders pursuant to subsection (6) or section 10 (4), until BaFin
determines that the capital requirements have been met, sections 7 to 7f, 9, 11, 11a, 14 and
15
of
the
Financial
Market
Stabilisation
Acceleration
Act
(Finanzmarktstabilisierungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) shall apply mutatis mutandis to
decisions on capital measures taken by the shareholders’ meeting of the institution. 2This
shall also apply if private or public bodies other than the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund
make a partial or full contribution to meeting the capital requirements.
Section 45a
Measures vis-à-vis financial holding companies and mixed financial holding
companies
(1) BaFin can prohibit a financial holding company at the head of a financial holding group
within the meaning of section 10a or a mixed financial holding company at the head of a
mixed financial holding group within the meaning of section 10a from exercising its voting
rights in the superordinated undertaking and the other subordinated undertakings if
1

the financial holding company or the mixed financial holding company fails to transmit
to the superordinated undertaking the data pursuant to Article 11 (1) sentence 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 required for consolidation pursuant to Articles 11 to 23
of Regulation (EU ) No 575/2013, unless the supervisory consolidation requirements
can be satisfied in some other way;

2

facts are known which reveal that a person who actually manages the business of the
financial holding company or the mixed financial holding company is not trustworthy
or does not have the professional qualifications required to manage the business.

(1a) 1In the cases cited in subsection (1) sentence 1 number 2, BaFin can also order the
superordinated undertaking of a financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group
not to comply with the instructions of the financial holding company or of the mixed financial
holding company if there are no possibilities under company law for removing the persons
who actually manage the business of the financial holding company or of the mixed financial
holding company. 2The same shall apply if such possibilities do exist but they have been
used without success.

161

Section 45b
(2) 1In the case of a prohibition pursuant to subsection (1) and at the request of BaFin, the
court having jurisdiction at the domicile of the superordinated undertaking pursuant to section
10a shall appoint a trustee to whom it transfers the exercise of the voting rights. 2In
exercising the voting rights, the trustee must take due account of the interests of a sound
management of the undertakings concerned, in conformity with banking supervisory
requirements. 3BaFin may request the appointment of a different trustee for good cause. 4If
the prerequisites specified in subsection (1) no longer exist, BaFin shall apply for the
appointment of the trustee to be revoked. 5The trustee shall be entitled to the reimbursement
of reasonable expenses and remuneration for his/her activities. 6The court shall determine
such expenses and remuneration at the trustee’s request; an appeal on a point of law
against the fixing of remuneration by the court shall not be permissible. 7The Federal
Government will advance such expenses and remuneration; the financial holding company or
the mixed financial holding company and the undertakings concerned shall be jointly and
severally liable to the Federal Government in respect of its outlays.
(3) As long as the prohibition order pursuant to subsection (1) is enforceable, the
undertakings concerned shall not be deemed to be subordinated undertakings of the
financial holding company or the mixed financial holding company within the meaning of
sections 10a and 13b.
Section 45b
Measures in the case of organisational deficiencies
(1) 1If an institution does not have a proper business organisation within the meaning of
section 25a (1), BaFin can, either prior to or together with an order pursuant to section 25a
(2) sentence 2 or pursuant to section 25c (4c), also in conjunction with a statutory order
pursuant to section 25a (6) or pursuant to section 25b, order, in particular, that the institution
1

must take measures to reduce risks insofar as they arise from certain types of
activities and products or through the use of certain systems or from the outsourcing
of activities and processes to another undertaking,

2

may establish further branches only with BaFin’s approval, and

3

may not engage in certain types of business, in particular the acceptance of deposits,
funds or securities of customers and lending pursuant to section 19 (1), or may
engage in such business only to a limited extent.

2

BaFin is entitled to order measures pursuant to sentence 1 in addition to setting out
increased own funds requirements pursuant to section 10 (3) sentence 2 number 10 as well
as together with or additionally to setting out increased own funds requirements pursuant to
section 51a (2) number 4.
(2) 1Subsection (1) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the relevant superordinated undertaking
within the meaning of section 10a as well as to an institution that is required pursuant to
section 22 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to carry out sub-consolidation, if a group of
institutions or a financial holding group or a mixed financial holding group does not have a
162

Section 45c

proper business organisation in contravention of section 25a (1) and section 25b; subsection
(1) sentence 1 number 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis provided that, instead of prohibiting or
limiting lending, BaFin can lower the large exposure limits applicable to the group of
institutions or financial holding group or mixed financial holding group pursuant to Articles
387 to 403 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended. 2If a branch of the institution in
a non-EEA country does not have an appropriate business organisation or is not in a position
to provide the information necessary to assess its business organisation or for inclusion in
the institution's organisational structure, or if it is not supervised effectively in the non-EEA
country or if the supervisory agency responsible for the branch is not prepared to engage in
satisfactory cooperation with BaFin, BaFin can also limit the business activities of the branch
or order its closure and liquidation.
(3) (Repealed)
Section 45c
Special representative
(1) 1BaFin may appoint a special representative, entrust him/her with the performance of
activities at an institution and assign him/her the requisite powers. 2The special
representative must be independent, trustworthy and suited to carrying out the activities
entrusted to him/her to ensure the sustainability of the institution’s business policy and to
safeguard financial stability; in cases where the special representative assumes tasks of a
senior manager or governing body, he/she must guarantee the professional qualifications
required. 3As part of the appointment, he/she is authorised to request information and
documentation from members of the governing bodies and employees of the institution,
attend in an advisory role all meetings of the governing bodies and other bodies of the
institution, enter the institution’s business premises, inspect its books and papers and
conduct enquiries. 4The governing bodies and members thereof are obliged to help the
special representative conduct his/her activities. 5He/she is obliged to furnish BaFin with all
information about any findings made in performing his/her tasks.
(2) In particular, BaFin may appoint the special representative to do the following:
1

to take over the activities and powers of one or more senior managers if facts are
known which reveal that the senior manager(s) of the institution is/are not trustworthy
or does/do not have the professional qualifications required to manage the institution.

2

to take over the activities and powers of one or more senior managers if the institution
no longer has the requisite number of senior managers, in particular because BaFin
has demanded the removal of a senior manager or prohibited that senior manager
from carrying out his/her activities.

3

To take over the activities and powers of governing bodies of the institution entirely or
in part if the conditions set out in section 36 (3) sentence 1 number 1 to 9 apply.

163

Section 45c

4

to take over the activities and powers of governing bodies of the institution entirely or
in part if the supervision of the institution is hampered as a result of circumstances
within the meaning of section 33 (3).

5

to take suitable measures to set up and safeguard proper business organisation
including appropriate risk management if the institution has persistently contravened
provisions of this Act, the Act on Building and Loan Associations, the Safe Custody
Act, the Money Laundering Act, the Capital Investment Code, the Pfandbrief Act, the
Payment Services Oversight Act, the Securities Trading Act, the regulations issued to
implement these Acts or the orders issued by BaFin.

6

to monitor the institution’s compliance with the orders issued by BaFin.

7

to draw up a restructuring plan for the institution if the conditions set out in section 45
(1) sentence 3 or (2) apply, to follow the execution of the restructuring plan and to
take over the powers as defined in section 45 (2) sentences 4 and 5.

7a

to draw up a plan pursuant to section 10 (4) sentence 6 for the institution if the
requirements of section 10 (4) sentence 1 are met and the institution has not
presented a suitable plan within a deadline set by BaFin, and to ensure the
implementation of said plan;

8

to monitor measures taken by the institution to avert a danger within the meaning of
section 35 (2) number 4 or of section 46 (1) sentence 1, to take measures him/herself
to avert a danger or to monitor compliance with measures taken by BaFin pursuant to
section 46.

9

to prepare a transfer order pursuant to section 48a.

10

to check claims for damages against members of governing bodies or former
members of governing bodies if there is evidence of grounds for damage to the
institution through breach of duty by said members.

(3) 1If the special representative takes over all activities and powers of a governing body or
the member of a governing body of the institution, the tasks and powers of the governing
body or member of the governing body in question shall be suspended. 2The special
representative may not carry out the role of one or more senior managers at the same time
as that of one or more members of an administrative or supervisory body. 3If the special
representative is granted only some of the powers of a governing body or a member of a
governing body, this shall have no effect on the powers of the appointed governing body or
member of a governing body of the institution. 4The activities and powers of one or more
senior managers may be transferred in their entirety to the special representative only in the
cases cited in (2) numbers 1, 2 and 4. 5His/her scope of powers of representation shall be
determined by the scope of powers of representation of the senior manager to whose
position he/she has been appointed. 6In cases where BaFin has transferred the role of senior
manager to a special representative, persons or governing bodies entitled under other
legislation to appoint senior managers may do so only with BaFin’s approval.

164

Section 46

(4) If BaFin transfers the activities and powers of a senior manager as defined in (2)
number 1 or number 2 to a special representative, the transfer, scope of powers of
representation and revocation of the transfer shall be entered officially in the commercial
register.
(5) The institution’s governing body that is responsible for the debarment of partners from the
management and representation or for the removal of persons with powers of management
or representation may, if there is good cause, apply to have the transfer of a senior
manager’s role to the special representative revoked.
(6) 1The costs incurred through the appointment of the special representative, including
reasonable expenses and the remuneration which he/she is to be paid, shall be borne by the
institution. 2The amount of the remuneration will be determined by BaFin. 3BaFin will
advance such expenses and remuneration at the special representative’s request.
(7) 1The special representative shall be liable for wilful intent and negligence. 2In the case of
negligent conduct, the special representative’s liability for damages shall be limited to €1
million. 3If this institution is a public limited company whose shares are admitted to trading on
the regulated market, liability for damages shall be limited to €50 million.
(8) Subsections (1) to (7) shall apply mutatis mutandis to financial holding companies or
mixed financial holding companies which are deemed to be superordinated undertakings
pursuant to section 10a and to persons who actually manage the business of such financial
holding companies or mixed financial holding companies.
Section 46
Measures in the case of danger
(1) 1If there is any danger to the discharge of an institution's obligations to its creditors,
especially to the safety of the assets entrusted to it, or if there are grounds for suspecting
that effective supervision of the institution is not possible (section 33 (3) numbers 1 to 3),
BaFin may take temporary measures to avert this danger. 2In particular, it may
1

issue instructions on the institution's management,

2

forbid the acceptance of deposits, funds or securities of customers and the granting of
loans (section 19 (1)),

3

prohibit proprietors and senior managers from carrying out their activities, or limit the
performance of these activities,

4

temporarily impose a ban on sales and payments by the institution,

5

order that the institution be closed for business with customers, and

6

prohibit the acceptance of payments not intended for the payment of debt vis-à-vis the
institution, unless the competent compensation scheme or other guarantee scheme
warrants that the obligees will be satisfied in full.

165

Section 46
3

Subject to the provisions of sentence 1, BaFin may ban or restrict payments to affiliated
undertakings if these transactions are disadvantageous to the institution. 4Furthermore, it
may stipulate that payments are only permitted under certain circumstances. 5Without delay,
BaFin shall notify the affected supervisory authorities in the member states of the European
Union, the European Central Bank and the Deutsche Bundesbank of the measures it intends
to take pursuant to sentences 3 and 4. 6Decisions on the distribution of profits shall be invalid
insofar as they contradict any order issued pursuant to sentences 1 and 2. 7In the case of
institutions organised in a form other than that of a sole proprietorship, managers who have
been prohibited from carrying out their activities shall be barred from managing and
representing the institution for the duration of the prohibition. 8Regarding the claims arising
from the employment contract or from other provisions governing the activities of the
manager, the general regulations shall apply. 9Rights permitting a manager to participate as
a partner or in other ways in decisions on measures affecting the management of the
institution may not be exercised for the duration of the prohibition.
(2) 1The competent compensation scheme or other guarantee scheme may make its
commitment within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 2 number 6 subject to the
condition that incoming payments not intended for the payment of debts pursuant to
subsection (1) sentence 2 number 6 to the institution are held and administered on behalf of
the scheme separately from the assets held by the institution at the time when the ban on
sales and payments pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 number 4 was imposed. 2After the
issuing of the ban on sales and payments pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 number 4,
the institution may complete the transactions in progress at the time of the issuing of the ban
and enter into new transactions insofar as these are necessary for completing the former
transactions, if and insofar as the appropriate deposit guarantee scheme or investor
compensation scheme supplies the funds required for the purpose or undertakes to
compensate the institution for any diminution in its assets resulting from these transactions
as a whole, insofar as such compensation is needed for the full satisfaction of all creditors.
3
Moreover, BaFin may authorise exceptions to the ban on sales and payments pursuant to
subsection (1) sentence 2 number 4 insofar as this is necessary for the performance of
transactions or the administration of the institution. 4In particular, it may order the
reimbursement of payments accepted or received by the institution contrary to an order
pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 number 6. 5It may establish a limit below which special
representatives can authorise exceptions from the ban on sales and payments. 6Compulsory
enforcements, attachments and temporary injunctions against the institution’s assets shall
not be permissible for the duration of measures pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2
numbers 4 to 6. 7The provisions of the Insolvency Code relating to the protection of payment
and securities transfer and settlement systems, including interoperable systems, as well as
of central banks' collateral security and of financial collateral arrangements shall apply
mutatis mutandis when ordering a measure pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2 numbers 4
to 6. 8The ordering of security measures pursuant to section 21 of the Insolvency Code shall
not affect the validity of the reimbursement of a payment accepted or received via a system
or an intermediary or received by the institution contrary to an order pursuant to subsection

166

Section 46a

(1) sentence 2 number 6 and which BaFin has ordered to be reimbursed pursuant to
sentence 4.

Section 46a
(Repealed)
Section 46b
Insolvency petition
(1) 1If an institution permitted to conduct business operations in Germany or a financial
holding company or mixed financial holding company which is deemed to be a
superordinated undertaking pursuant to section 10a becomes insolvent or overindebted, the
senior managers, the proprietor in the case of an institution operating in the form of a sole
proprietorship and the persons who actually manage the business of the financial holding
company or mixed financial holding company shall report this fact to BaFin without delay,
enclosing informative documentation; the aforementioned persons must also provide such
notification along with the corresponding documentation if the institution or the financial
holding company or mixed financial holding company which is deemed to be a
superordinated undertaking pursuant to section 10a is not expected to be in a position to fulfil
its existing payment obligations when they fall due (imminent insolvency). 2Insofar as these
persons are required under other legislation to file a petition for the initiation of insolvency
proceedings in the event of insolvency or overindebtedness, the reporting requirement
pursuant to sentence 1 shall replace the requirement to file such a petition. 3Insolvency
proceedings over the assets of an institution or a financial holding company or mixed
financial holding company which is deemed to be a superordinated undertaking pursuant to
section 10a shall be initiated in the event of insolvency, overindebtedness or, under the
conditions set out in sentence 5, also in the event of imminent insolvency. 4The petition for
the initiation of insolvency proceedings over the assets of an institution or a financial holding
company or mixed financial holding company which is deemed to be a superordinated
undertaking pursuant to section 10a may be filed only by BaFin. 5In the event of imminent
insolvency, however, BaFin may file the petition only with the consent of the institution and,
in the case of a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company deemed to be
a superordinated undertaking pursuant to section 10a, with its consent. 6The insolvency court
must consult BaFin before appointing a suitable insolvency administrator. 7The court order to
commence insolvency proceedings shall be specially delivered to BaFin. 8The insolvency
court shall send BaFin all further decisions relating to the proceedings and shall inform it of
the status and progress of the proceedings when requested to do so. 9BaFin may inspect the
records relating to the insolvency proceedings.
(2) 1If insolvency proceedings are initiated in respect of an institution which participates in a
system within the meaning of section 24b (1), BaFin shall notify the European Securities and
Markets Authority (ESMA), the ESRB and the agencies whose names have been
communicated by the other EEA states to the European Commission without delay.
167

Section 46c
2

Sentence 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to system operators within the meaning of section
24b (5).
(3) 1The insolvency administrator shall inform BaFin on an ongoing basis about the status
and progress of the insolvency proceedings, in particular by transferring the reports for the
insolvency court, the creditors' meeting or a committee of creditors. 2BaFin may also request
additional information and documents relating to the insolvency proceedings.
Section 46c
Insolvency law periods and liability issues
(1) The periods to be calculated pursuant to sections 88 and 130 to 136 of the Insolvency
Code from the date on which the request to open the insolvency proceedings was filed shall
be calculated from the day on which a measure pursuant to section 46 (1) is ordered.
(2) 1It is assumed that any payments that were made by the institution between a BaFin
order pursuant to section 46 (1) sentence 2 numbers 4 to 6 and the insolvency petition and
that are permitted under section 46 do not disadvantage the institution’s creditors and are
compatible with the diligence of a prudent businessman. 2BaFin acts dutifully in its activities
if, in exercising its powers, it could reasonably assume that it could achieve the aims of the
Act based on appropriate information. 3This is without prejudice to section 4 (4) of the Act
Establishing the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.
Section 46d
Notification of the other EEA states with regard to reorganisation measures
(1) 1BaFin shall notify the competent authorities in the other EEA states before it orders
reorganisation measures, in particular measures pursuant to section 46, to be carried out at
a CRR credit institution. 2If this is not possible, the competent authorities must be informed
immediately after such measures have been ordered. 3The same shall apply insofar as
measures pursuant to section 46 are taken against the branches of an undertaking within the
meaning of section 53 domiciled in a non-EEA state. 4In this case, BaFin shall inform the
competent authorities in the other EEA states in which the undertaking has established
further branches. 5This shall be without prejudice to the provisions of section 8 (3) to (7).
(2) 1Reorganisation measures which prejudice the rights of third parties in a host member
state and against which legal remedies may be sought must be announced immediately
without an accompanying statement of reasons in the Official Journal of the European Union
and in at least two national newspapers of the host member states in the official language or
languages of the relevant EEA states. 2This announcement must stipulate which agency or
authority has received the accompanying explanatory memorandum, the subject matter of
and legal basis for the decision, the time limits for legal remedies including deadlines,
BaFin’s address as the authority which would decide if an objection were filed and the
address of the competent administrative court. 3Such announcement is not a prerequisite for
validity.
168

Section 46e
(3) 1Reorganisation measures within the meaning of subsections (1) and (2) are measures
pursuant to both section 46 and section 6 (3) by means of which the financial situation of a
CRR credit institution is to be reinforced or restored and which could prejudice the existing
rights of third parties in a host member state of the EEA, including measures which allow a
suspension of payments or which serve to bolster the reorganisation measures ordered by
supervisory authorities in the EEA. 2Reorganisation measures are to be designated as such.
3
With due regard for the reorganisation measures, sections 336, 337, 338, 340 and 351 (2) of
the Insolvency Code shall apply as appropriate to contracts on the use or acquisition of an
immovable object, to employment contracts and employment relationships, to set-offs, to
repurchase agreements within the meaning of section 340b of the German Commercial
Code, to netting agreements and contracts for novation as well as to the rights in rem of third
parties unless otherwise stipulated in this Act.
(4) 1Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply if and insofar as only the rights of persons
involved in the internal corporate structure as well as those of the management and
shareholders of a CRR credit institution may be prejudiced in one of these capacities.
2
Notification and announcement pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) are not necessary in the
case of CRR credit institutions which do not operate on a cross-border basis.
(5) 1BaFin shall support reorganisation measures ordered by the authorities of the home
state to be carried out at a CRR credit institution domiciled in another EEA state. 2If it
considers it necessary to carry out remedial measures at a CRR credit institution domiciled in
another EEA state, it shall inform the competent authorities of this state accordingly.
Section 46e
Insolvency proceedings in EEA states
(1) 1The relevant authorities or courts of the home member state shall be solely responsible
for initiating insolvency proceedings over the assets of a CRR credit institution within the
EEA. 2If another state of the EEA is the home member state of a CRR credit institution and
insolvency proceedings are initiated there over the assets of this institution, then these
proceedings shall be recognised irrespective of the provisions of section 343 (1) of the
Insolvency Code.
(2) Secondary insolvency proceedings pursuant to section 356 of the Insolvency Code and
any other territorial insolvency proceedings pursuant to section 354 of the Insolvency Code
are not permissible with regard to CRR credit institutions which are domiciled in another EEA
state.
(3) 1The office of the insolvency court must immediately forward the order to initiate
proceedings to BaFin, which in turn shall promptly inform the competent authorities in the
other EEA host member states that proceedings have been initiated. 2Notwithstanding the
announcement envisaged by section 30 of the Insolvency Code, the insolvency court must
publish extracts from the court order to initiate proceedings in the Official Journal of the
European Union and in at least two national newspapers of the host member states in which

169

Section 46f
the credit institution concerned has a branch or provides services. 3This publication is to be
preceded by the form pursuant to section 46f (1) of this Act.
(4) 1BaFin can request information about the status of the insolvency proceedings from the
insolvency court and the insolvency administrator at any time. 2It is obliged, upon the request
of the competent authorities in other EEA states, to inform the said authorities about the
status of the insolvency proceedings.
(5) 1If BaFin files a petition for the initiation of insolvency proceedings over the assets of a
branch of an undertaking domiciled in a non-EEA state, it shall, without delay, notify the
competent authorities in the EEA states in which the undertaking has a further branch or
provides services. 2The notification must also include information about the contents and
legal validity of the permission pursuant to section 32. 3The persons and bodies involved
shall endeavour to take a concerted approach.
Section 46f
Notification of creditors in insolvency proceedings
(1) 1On issuing the court order to initiate proceedings, the office of the insolvency court shall
send the creditors a form bearing the heading “Invitation to lodge a claim and submit
observations relating to a claim. Time limits to be observed” in all of the official languages of
the EEA. 2The form shall be published in the Federal Gazette by the Federal Ministry of
Justice and shall contain the following information in particular:
1

the time limits which are to be observed and the penalties for breaching these time
limits.

2

the body empowered to accept the lodgement of claims or observations relating to
claims.

3

other measures which have been laid down.

how important it is for creditors whose claims are preferential or secured in rem to
lodge these claims and the extent to which they must do so.

(2) 1Creditors whose place of habitual abode, residence or domicile is in another EEA state
can lodge their claims in the official language or one of the official languages of that state.
2
The lodgement of claims must bear the heading “Lodgement of claim and submission of
observations relating to claims” in German, ie "Anmeldung und Erläuterung einer Forderung".
3
Upon request, the creditor must provide a translation of the lodgement of claim and
submission of observations relating to claims, which is to be certified by a person authorised
to do so in the state relevant to sentence 1.
(3) The insolvency administrator must regularly inform the creditors about developments in
the insolvency proceedings in an appropriate form.

Section 46g
Moratorium, suspension of banking and stock exchange business
(1) If there is reason to fear that credit institutions may encounter financial difficulties which
are likely to pose grave dangers to the economy as a whole, and particularly to the proper
functioning of the general payment system, the Federal Government may, by way of a
statutory order,
1

grant a credit institution an extension of time to discharge its obligations and order
that compulsory enforcements, attachments and temporary injunctions against the
credit institution as well as the initiation of insolvency proceedings over the credit
institution's assets are not permissible for the duration of the extension;

2

order that credit institutions be temporarily closed for business with customers and
that they may neither make nor accept payments and credit transfers connected with
such customer business; it may limit this order to certain types or categories of credit
institutions and to particular types of banking business;

3

order that stock exchanges within the meaning of the Stock Exchange Act
(Börsengesetz) be temporarily closed.

(2) Before taking measures pursuant to subsection (1), the Federal Government must consult
the Deutsche Bundesbank.
(3) If the Federal Government takes measures pursuant to subsection (1), it must specify by
way of a statutory order the legal consequences of these measures for prescribed periods
and deadlines in the fields of civil law, commercial law, company law, bill of exchange law,
cheque law and procedural law.
Section 46h
Resumption of banking and stock exchange business
(1) 1For the period after a temporary closure of credit institutions and stock exchanges
pursuant to section 46g (1) numbers 2 and 3, the Federal Government, after having
consulted the Deutsche Bundesbank, may issue by way of a regulation provisions on the
resumption of payments, credit transfers and stock market business. 2In particular, it may
rule that the withdrawal of credit balances is subject to temporary restrictions. 3Such
restrictions may not be imposed in respect of sums of money accepted after a temporary
closure of credit institutions.
(2) The statutory orders issued pursuant to subsection (1) and section 46g (1) shall become
inoperative three months after the date of their promulgation if they have not already been
rescinded.

Division 4a

MEASURES TO PREPARE AND CONDUCT RECOVERY AND
RESOLUTION ACTIONS

Section 47
Recovery plan and resolution planning at credit institutions and financial groups with
the potential to pose a systemic risk
(1) 1Credit institutions regarded as potentially posing a systemic risk by BaFin shall prepare a
recovery plan. 2The recovery plan shall specify which of the measures to be taken by the
credit institution can be used to restore the financial stability of the credit institution if there is
a major deterioration in its financial situation and if this deterioration may lead to a goingconcern risk if suitable countermeasures are not taken promptly by the credit institution
(crisis event). 3If the credit institution regarded as potentially posing a systemic risk is part of
a group of institutions or financial holding group (referred to in this subsection as financial
groups) or if the financial group with the potential to poses a systemic risk, sentence one
shall apply under the condition that only the superordinated undertaking must prepare a
recovery plan which applies to the entire financial group. 4A credit institution has the potential
to pose a systemic risk if its going-concern risk could trigger a systemic risk within the
meaning of section 48a (2) number 1 in conjunction with section 48b (2). 5A financial group
has the potential to pose a systemic risk if the going-concern risk of at least one group
company can trigger a systemic risk; the provisions of sections 48o and 48p shall apply
mutatis mutandis. 6In consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, BaFin shall classify credit
institutions with the potential to pose a systemic risk on the basis of a qualitative and
quantitative analysis, taking particular account of the size of the credit institution, its domestic
and cross-border business activities, its interconnectedness with the German and
international financial system and the replaceability of the services and the financial
infrastructure it provides.
(2) 1BaFin shall be responsible for resolution planning. 2Resolution planning shall comprise
the following tasks:
1

assessing the resolvability of credit institutions and financial groups pursuant to
section 47d

2

removing obstacles to resolvability pursuant to section 47e

3

creating resolution plans pursuant to sections 47f and 47g for credit institutions and
financial groups with the potential to pose a systemic risk

4

exercising the powers pursuant to section 47h and

5

preparing measures imposed by BaFin pursuant to sections 48a to 48s.

172

Section 47a

Section 47a
Design of recovery plans
(1) The structure of the recovery plan shall depend on the size, complexity and
interconnectedness of the credit institution or the financial group as well as the type, scale
and complexity of the business model and the associated risk.
(2) The recovery plan shall contain the following major components, in particular
1

a summary of the main content of the recovery plan, including an assessment of the
credit institution or the financial group's ability to restructure

2

a strategic analysis of the credit institution or the financial group, which shall contain
the following:
(a)

a presentation of its corporate structure and business model,

(b)

a list of its material business activities and critical business activities,

(c)

a description of its internal and external connective structures;

3

a list of recovery options available to the credit institution or the financial group in
order to restore financial stability in the event of a crisis;

4

a description of the conditions and the key steps for implementing recovery options.
This shall also include a description of the consequences of the recovery options for
employees and their representatives;

5

a list of the impediments which limit or prevent the implementation of the recovery
options and a description of whether and how these impediments can be overcome;

6

a list of severe stress scenarios that could trigger a crisis, and their impact on the
credit institution or the financial group; the stress scenarios should contain both
systemic events and events that affect the individual credit institution and that reflect
the risk potential specific to the credit institution or group;

7

the definition of indicators that allow the prompt implementation of recovery options
intended to restore the financial stability of the credit institution or the financial group
so that it can overcome a future crisis by itself without stabilisation measures from the
public sector; in the outline, it may be assumed that public or private sector owners
and private or public security systems will provide support measures to overcome a
crisis if there is agreement from the owners or security systems or if support
measures are the normal procedure in similar cases;

8

an examination of the effectiveness and feasibility of the recovery plan using the
stress scenarios;

9

a communication and information plan which describes the internal and external
communication arrangements regarding the implementation of each of the identified
recovery options and

173

Section 47a

10

a list of preparatory measures that the institution has taken or intends to take to
improve the implementation of the recovery plan.

(3) The recovery plan must also fulfil the following requirements:
1

implementing the recovery options must allow the financial stability and viability of the
credit institution or the financial group to be restored and safeguarded in the long
term.

2

it must be possible to implement recovery options effectively in a crisis without
causing any significant adverse effect on the financial system.

(4) 1In agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, BaFin shall require credit institutions
which it has classified as potentially posing a systemic risk pursuant to section 47 (1) to
present a recovery plan within a period not exceeding six months. 2At the request of the
credit institution, BaFin may extend the deadline by up to six months. 3The relevant credit
institutions shall update their recovery plan at least once a year or following changes to the
legal or organisational structure of the credit institution, its business activities, its financial
situation or the general risk situation that may have a substantial impact on the recovery plan
or that make it necessary to amend the plan for other reasons. 4BaFin may order the relevant
credit institutions to update their recovery plans more frequently. 5Sentences 1 to 3 shall
apply mutatis mutandis to the superordinated undertaking of a financial group with the
potential to pose a systemic risk.
(5) All members of the management board within the meaning of section 1 (2) shall be
responsible for creating, implementing and updating the recovery plan as well as
implementing it in a crisis, irrespective of the internal allocation of responsibilities.
(6) 1Within this subsection, material business activities shall be taken to mean activities
which may significantly affect the assets, finances and earnings of the credit institution or
financial group. 2Material business activities shall also include activities which, from the point
of view of the credit institution or the financial group, could lead to considerable losses in
revenue or profit, considerable losses or a considerable loss in equity value in the event of a
failure. 3Critical business activities within the meaning of this subsection are business
activities which, if interrupted or not resolved in an orderly manner, could have a significant
negative impact on other undertakings in the financial sector, on the financial markets or on
the general confidence of investors and other market participants in the functioning of the
financial system.

174

Section 47b

Section 47b
Measures in the case of deficient recovery plans
(1) Credit institutions with the potential to pose a systemic risk shall submit their recovery
plans to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank. They shall also submit them after every
update.
(2) 1If BaFin, in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank, does not consider the recovery
plan submitted to meet the requirements of section 47a (1) to (3), it shall inform the relevant
credit institution of the shortcomings of the recovery plan. 2In this case, BaFin shall require
the credit institution to submit a revised plan within a time frame of three months. 3Moreover,
the credit institution shall specify how the deficiencies identified by BaFin have been rectified.
(3) If the relevant credit institution fails to submit a revised recovery plan or if the revised
recovery plan does not rectify the identified deficiencies, BaFin may order the credit
institution to take all measures to rectify the deficiencies within a time limit specified by
BaFin.
(4) 1If the deficiencies identified point to impediments that prevent or significantly impair
recovery in the event of a crisis (impediments to recovery), BaFin may demand, in particular,
that the necessary measures are taken to
1

ease the reduction of the credit institution's risk profile,

2

enable recapitalisation measures to be taken promptly,

3

allow corrections to be made to the funding strategy or

4

change the corporate governance procedures to allow recovery options from the
recovery plan to be implemented promptly and rapidly.

2

Before ordering a measure, BaFin shall examine whether the measure is needed because
the obstacles to recovery that were identified can no longer be rectified promptly in the event
of an imminent risk situation and there is thus a risk that, should a crisis occur, a goingconcern risk to the credit institution could no longer be effectively avoided. It shall also
examine whether the burdens associated with the measure are proportionate to the systemic
risk caused by the going-concern risk. 3The credit institution shall first be given the
opportunity to remedy the situation. 4Measures pursuant to sentence 1 shall be harmonised
with potential measures pursuant to section 47e (3) and (4).
(5) Subsections 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the superordinated undertaking of a
financial group with the potential to pose a systemic risk.

175

Section 47c

Section 47c
Resolution unit
(1) 1At BaFin, resolution planning shall be carried out by a separate organisational unit
independently of the ongoing banking supervision tasks (resolution unit). 2The resolution unit
is also responsible for the application to conduct the reorganisation procedure pursuant to
section 7 of the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act, for exercising the associated powers
and for their preparation, as well as for the tasks of BaFin pursuant to sections 48a to 48s.
3
Tasks relating to the creation and evaluation of recovery plans and the ordering of measures
pursuant to section 47b may also be transferred to the resolution unit.
(2) 1Mutual support and an unimpeded exchange of information must be assured between
the resolution unit and the areas of ongoing supervision. 2Section 7 shall apply mutatis
mutandis to cooperation with the Deutsche Bundesbank pursuant to this subsection.
(3) BaFin shall provide the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency with updates on the current
status of resolution planning.
Section 47d
Assessment of resolvability
(1) BaFin shall continuously assess whether a credit institution or a financial group can be
resolved.
(2) 1A credit institution or financial group shall be considered able to be resolved if BaFin,
after consulting the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency, reaches the conclusion that the
credit institution or the members of the financial group that are credit institutions
1

can complete regular insolvency proceedings without creating systemic risk within the
meaning of section 48b (2) or

2

can be resolved using a resolution tool in a manner that allows the resolution
objectives listed in section 47f (2) to be achieved in compliance with the principles set
out in section 47f (4).

2

The use of a resolution tool refers, in particular, to the issue of a transfer order pursuant to
sections 48a to 48s, including other measures pursuant to this Act that are ordered in
addition to the transfer order.
(3) 1The assessment of the resolvability of a credit institution or financial group must also
take into account the feasibility of a resolution if a resolution is required to prevent or
eliminate systemic risk. 2In this case, it is necessary to examine, in particular
1

the extent to which material business activities and critical business activities can be
allocated to certain legal entities of the financial group;

2

the extent to which legal and corporate structures are designed to allow the
separation of the material business activities and critical business activities and
176

Section 47d

especially to ensuring this separation is not prevented or impeded by internal
interconnections;
3

the extent to which arrangements are in place to ensure there are sufficient resources
in terms of staff, infrastructures, liquidity and capital to support and maintain material
business activities and critical business activities in the event of going-concern risk;

4

the extent to which
(a) the credit institution or member of the financial group, as the recipient or provider
of services, has concluded service level agreements which may affect the
business activities of the credit institution, members of the financial group or third
parties, and
(b) such service level agreements are fully enforceable in the event of a goingconcern risk or the resolution of the credit institution or a member of the financial
group, regardless of whether the credit institution or a member of the financial
group is the recipient or provider of the service;

5

the extent to which the credit institution or a member of the financial group has a
procedure for transferring the services received or provided on the basis of service
level agreements in the event of a spin-off of material business activities or critical
business activities;

6

the extent to which provisions have been made to ensure permanent access to
financial market infrastructures;

7

whether the technical and organisational resources are sufficient to ensure that BaFin
receives correct and complete information about the material business activities and
the critical business activities at any time;

8

whether the credit institution or the members of the financial group are able, using
their technical and organisational resources, to provide BaFin with the key information
needed to effectively resolve the credit institution or the financial group at any time,
even under rapidly changing conditions;

9

the extent to which the credit institution or members of the financial group have
subjected their technical and organisational resources to a stress test based on
scenarios specified or approved by BaFin;

10

the extent to which the credit institution or the members of the financial group can
guarantee that their technical and organisational resources remain operational, both
for the affected credit institution or the members of the affected financial group as well
as, in the event that the material business activities are separated from the critical
business activities, for a potential resolution authority which takes over the credit
institution or a member of the financial group;

11

the extent to which the credit institution or the members of the financial group have in
place adequate procedures to ensure that BaFin receives or can obtain information
that is needed to identify the depositors and the amounts covered by the deposit
guarantee schemes;
177

Section 47d

12

the extent to which group surety, guarantee or security agreements are affected and
hedging transactions are made at market conditions, the extent to which the risk
management systems are reliable with regard to such agreements and the extent to
which such agreements increase the risk of contagion within the financial group;

13

the extent to which the legal structure of the financial group, the number of legal
entities, the complexity of the group structure, including tax and balance sheet links or
intercompany agreements, or the difficulty of gearing business activities to legal
entities that limit or could limit resolvability;

14

the extent to which, if the assessment relates to a mixed financial holding company,
the resolution of undertakings belonging to the financial group that involve credit
institutions, financial services institutions or other financial undertakings, may have a
negative impact on the parts of the financial group that operate outside the financial
sector;

15

whether foreign authorities have tools that are suited to supporting the use of
resolution tools and resolution powers pursuant to this Act and what options exist for
coordinated measures between BaFin and authorities of this kind abroad;

16

whether the resolution tools and resolution powers can be used, given the structure of
the credit institution or the financial group;

17

the extent to which the group structure allows BaFin to resolve the entire financial
group or one or more of its entities without creating systemic risk;

18

in what way the use of resolution tools and resolution powers at the credit institution
or members of the financial group can be made easier or in which cases they do not
need to be used at all;

19

the likelihood of achieving the objective of the resolution through the use of resolution
tools and resolution powers given the potential impact on creditors, counterparties,
customers and employees, permissions and licences as well as potential measures
by authorities outside of Germany;

20

whether it is possible to adequately evaluate the impact that the resolution of the
credit institution or financial group, in particular the use of resolution tools or
resolution powers, could have on the financial system and the confidence of the
financial markets;

21

whether spillover effects to other financial market participants can be contained
through the use of resolution tools and resolution powers;

22

whether the resolution of the credit institution or the financial group, in particular the
use of resolution tools or resolution powers, could materially affect the operation of
financial market infrastructures, and

23

the extent to which, in the event that only a resolution pursuant to subsection (2)
number 2 comes into question, the losses of shareholders of the institution being
resolved and its creditors can be borne.

178

Section 47e
(4) 1BaFin will review the resolvability assessment annually and update it if necessary. 2It can
perform additional assessments, particularly if there have been changes at the credit
institution or financial group or in the markets in which the credit institution or financial group
is active which may influence the result of the assessment.
(5) 1The resolvability of a financial group that falls within the scope of subsection (1), that
also operates outside Germany and, in the event of a going-concern risk, could also
jeopardise the stability of the financial system outside of Germany, shall be assessed in
agreement with the resolution authorities of the affected EEA states or the affected non-EEA
states (resolution college). 2When assessing the resolvability of a credit institution that is not
a member of a cross-border financial group but that also operates outside of Germany, BaFin
will decide whether such agreement is necessary or helpful. 3Section 8e shall apply mutatis
mutandis.
Section 47e
Powers to remove impediments to resolvability
(1) 1If in the course of its assessment pursuant to section 47d, and after consultation with the
Deutsche Bundesbank, BaFin identifies impediments to resolvability at a credit institution
with the potential to pose a systemic risk, it will notify the credit institution or the
superordinate undertaking of a financial group with the potential to pose a systemic risk of
this fact. 2The notification shall specify which impediments to resolvability have been
identified.
(2) 1The notification shall specify a suitable period of time in which the recipient must propose
measures to remove the specified impediments. 2After consulting the Deutsche Bundesbank,
BaFin will assess whether the proposed measures are suitable for effectively removing the
impediments. 3BaFin may involve responsible German and foreign authorities if it considers
their involvement to be necessary or helpful. 4Section 47d (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(3) 1Should BaFin conclude that the impediments cannot be effectively removed through the
proposed measures, it may demand alternative measures. 2When ordering a measure
pursuant to sentence 1, BaFin will verify
1

that the measure is consistent with the resolution objectives listed in section 47f (2),

2

whether the measure is necessary because the impediments to resolution can no
longer be overcome promptly in the event that a specific risk occurs and, owing to the
impediments to resolution, there is a risk that systemic risk can longer be avoided
effectively should a crisis occur, and

3

that the burdens associated with the measure are proportionate to the otherwise
imminent systemic risk and its potential impact.

(4) 1Under the conditions set out in subsection (3), BaFin may demand, in particular, that

179

Section 47f

1

service level agreements on the continuation of material business activities or critical
business activities are concluded within the financial group or with third parties,

2

the credit institution or, in the case of a financial group, one or more members of the
financial group, limit the maximum individual and aggregate risk positions,

3

extraordinary or regular requirements to provide information already in place or newly
created by BaFin are adhered to,

4

certain assets are sold,

5

existing or planned business activities are limited or discontinued,

6

changes are made to the legal or operational structures of the institution or the
financial group in order to reduce complexity and ensure that material business
activities or critical business activities can be separated legally and financially from
other functions through the use of resolution tools or resolution powers,

7

a parent company, a parent financial holding company or an EU parent financial
holding company is established,

8

measures to increase loss sustainability are implemented, and

9

if the situation at the credit institution involves a subsidiary of a mixed holding
company which establishes a mixed holding company to control the institution of a
separate financial holding company in order to facilitate the resolution of the credit
institution and to prevent the use of resolution tools and resolution powers from
having a negative impact on the parts of the financial group that operate outside the
financial sector.

2

BaFin shall only demand the measures specified in numbers 4 to 6 after the recipient has
been given another opportunity to propose measures to remove the impediments and BaFin
does not consider that these measures are suited to effectively removing the impediments.
(5) 1BaFin may, at its discretion, involve the resolution college. 2BaFin will inform the recipient
of the notification of the measures pursuant to subsection (1) and will request that he or she
implement these measures within a specified period of time. 3BaFin will inform the Deutsche
Bundesbank of the measure and that it has been imposed.
Section 47f
Creation of a resolution plan
(1) 1BaFin will create a resolution plan for each credit institution with the potential to pose a
systemic risk, is not part of a financial group with the potential to pose a systemic risk and is
subject to supervision on a consolidated basis by BaFin pursuant to the Banking Directive. 2If
the assessment of resolvability pursuant to section 47d has revealed obstacles to the
creation of a resolution plan, these obstacles must first be removed pursuant to section 47e.
(2) 1The resolution plan shall take into account the resolution objective of preventing or
making it easier to eliminate systemic risk. 2Insofar as they are consistent with the objective
180

Section 47f

of preventing or making it easier to eliminate systemic risk, the following additional objectives
shall be taken into consideration
1

ensuring the continuity of critical business activities;

2

preventing contagion to other financial market participants;

3

endeavouring to keep the cost of a resolution as low as possible for the general public
and to protect public funds;

4

protecting depositors as defined in Directive 94/19/EC and investors as defined in
Directive 97/9/EC, and

5

protecting customers' funds and assets.

(3) 1The resolution plan shall envisage the use of resolution tools in the event that the
conditions laid out in section 48a (2) are met with regard to the relevant credit institution.
2
The resolution plan shall take into account various scenarios, including the event that the
going-concern risk and its causes are limited to the individual credit institution or that the
going-concern risk occurs during a period of general financial instability or systemic events.
3
The resolution plan shall only envisage financial support in the form of the funding
mechanisms created under the Restructuring Fund Act (Restrukturierungsfondsgesetz).
(4) The resolution plan shall be drawn up in accordance with the following principles:
1

reliance on extraordinary public financial support shall be avoided; the resources of
the restructuring fund should be used efficiently and sparingly.

2

market discipline shall be maintained on the financial markets.

3

the shareholders of the institution under resolution shall be called upon first to sustain
losses.

4

after the shareholders, the creditors of the institution under resolution shall shoulder
the losses pursuant to the regulations specified in sections 48a to 48s insofar as this
is compatible with the resolution objectives specified in subsection (2).

5

no creditor shall bear a greater loss than he or she would do were the institution to be
liquidated through regular insolvency proceedings. In this context, at the time a
resolution instrument is used, it is permissible to calculate a global insolvency rate
based on the capital gaps identified at this point in time.

6

all senior managers at the credit institution under resolution shall be excluded from
the management board unless BaFin is of the opinion that the manager did not
contribute to the emergence of a going-concern risk or the exclusion of the senior
manager would further jeopardise the stability of the credit institution.

7

all senior managers at the credit institution under resolution shall participate in the
losses to the extent of their individual responsibility for the failure of the institution
pursuant to civil and criminal law.

(5) 1The resolution plan shall contain the following elements:
181

Section 47f

1

a summary of the main components of the resolution plan,

2

a summary of the material changes that have taken place in the credit institution since
the plan was first created or last updated,

(e) details of the main business partners and an analysis of the impact of the failure
of these business partners on the situation of the relevant significant legal entity,
(f) details of all financial market infrastructures to which the relevant significant legal
entity is linked directly or indirectly, including the allocation to the material
business activities and the critical business activities,
(g) details of the technical and organisational resources of the relevant significant
legal entity, including information about their actual and legal framework,
particularly concerning licences, service level agreements and maintenance,

person for the relevant significant legal entity who reports to the management
board and
(i)

all major agreements between the relevant significant legal entity and third
parties which could be terminated directly or indirectly by the use of a resolution
tool, a resolution power, an insolvency or a contractually defined pre-insolvency
event, and information as to whether the consequences of the termination may
impair the use of a resolution tool or a resolution power; the same shall apply if
the third party cannot terminate the agreement, but can trigger other potentially
negative consequences, such as a penalty, for the relevant significant legal
entity;

4

comments on how material business activities and critical business activities can be
legally and financial separated to the extent required in order to ensure their continuity
in the event that the credit institution is resolved,

5

an estimated time frame for the implementation of all major parts of the plan,

explanations as to how the various resolution measures can be financed, taking into
account the requirements pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 3,

11

a detailed description of the various resolution strategies that may be applied in the
different scenarios within the meaning of section 47d (2) number 9,

12

comments on critical interconnections

13

a description of the options for maintaining access to financial market infrastructures,

14

if relevant, an outline of the involvement and cooperation of foreign authorities and

15

a plan for communicating with the media and the public.

2

BaFin may add further components to the resolution plan.

(6) 1The resolution plan shall be presented for comment to the Deutsche Bundesbank and
Financial Market Stabilisation Agency. 2It shall be updated at least once a year and shall also
be revised and updated if necessary following material changes to the legal or organisational
structure of the credit institution, its business activities or its financial situation that may have
a major impact on the feasibility of the plan. 3The same shall apply if the assessment of
resolvability or the review of this assessment pursuant to section 47d (4) reveals that
changes to the recovery plan are needed.
(7) 1Recovery plans concerning institutions that fall within the scope of subsection (1), also
operate abroad and could jeopardise the stability of a foreign financial markets in the event of
a going-concern risk should be drawn up in a resolution college. 2Section 8e shall apply
mutatis mutandis.
(8) BaFin may dispense with the creation of a resolution plan pursuant to subsection (1) if
1

2

the credit institution with the potential to pose a systemic risk is part of a group with
the potential to cause a systemic risk which, although not supervised on a
consolidated basis by BaFin pursuant to the Banking Directive, is considered by
BaFin, particularly through its participation in a resolution college, to have a resolution
plan drawn up by a third party that sufficiently covers the event of the going-concern
risk of the credit institution with the potential to pose a systemic risk and
BaFin sufficiently documents its assessment.

183

Section 47g

Section 47g
Group resolution plans
(1) 1BaFin will create a resolution plan (group resolution plan) for each credit institution with
the potential to pose a systemic risk that is subject to supervision on a consolidated basis by
BaFin pursuant to the Banking Directive. 2BaFin shall consult the Deutsche Bundesbank and
the Federal Agency for Financial Market Stabilisation before completing the group resolution
plan.
(2) The group resolution plan shall cover the following members of the financial group
1

if the financial group with the potential to pose a systemic risk involves a group of
institutions, the superordinate undertaking within the meaning of section 10a (1)
sentence 1 and all subordinated undertakings within the meaning of section 10a (1)
sentence 2, regardless of whether they potentially pose a systemic risk in isolation

2

if the financial group with the potential to pose a systemic risk involves a financial
holding group, the financial holding company and all subordinated undertakings within
the meaning of section 10a (1) sentence 2, regardless of whether they potentially
pose a systemic risk in isolation

(3) 1The group resolution plan envisages the use of resolution tools in the event that the
conditions laid out in section 48o or section 48p are met. 2Section 47f (1) sentence 2,
subsections (2), (3) sentence 2 and 3, subsections (4), (6) and (7) shall apply mutatis
mutandis to group resolution plans.
(4) 1The content of the group resolution plan shall be based on section 47f (5). 2Furthermore,
in the group resolution plan, BaFin shall, in particular
1

focus on describing cooperation and coordination with foreign agencies and on who is
to bear the burden internationally if the financial group or one of its members is
jeopardised as a going concern. In particular, it shall provide information about the
responsible supervisory and resolution authorities of the relevant significant legal
entity and the potential funding of the various resolution measures as well as, if
appropriate, approaches to dividing responsibility for funding between funding
sources in several countries;

2

outline the measures to be taken by the financial group as a whole or by part of the
financial group in the scenarios defined;

3

analyse the extent to which resolution tools and resolution powers can be applied,
exercised and mutually recognised as part of international cooperation.

Section 47h

Section 47h
Duties to cooperate; authority to issue orders
(1) 1Credit institutions and financial groups shall provide BaFin immediately with all
information that BaFin requires in the course of the resolution planning process. 2If
necessary, BaFin may request that a particular piece of information is accompanied by a
summary analysis.
(2) 1BaFin may also request estimates, analyses, reports and other types of cooperation if it
deems these necessary for resolution planning purposes. 2In particular, BaFin may demand
that the relevant credit institution or the superordinate undertaking of the relevant financial
group draft parts of the documents to be drawn up for resolution planning and make them
available to BaFin.
(3) BaFin is not obliged to reimburse the costs and expenses incurred by the credit institution
or the superordinate undertaking of the financial group as a result of subsections (1) and (2).
(4) 1The Federal Ministry of Finance, acting in consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank,
may issue by way of a statutory order more detailed provisions on the nature, scope, timing
and form of the duties to cooperate, which may also include the regular provision of
information, insofar as this is necessary to the fulfilment of BaFin's tasks. 2It may delegate
this authority by way of a statutory order to BaFin, provided that statutory orders of BaFin are
issued in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank. 3The central associations of the
institutions shall be consulted before the statutory order is issued.
Section 47i
Confidentiality and exchange of information
(1) 1Subject to the provision in subsection (3), BaFin shall treat as confidential the results of
the resolution planning, the next steps following the announcement of the results of the
resolvability assessment and the information, estimates, analyses and reports made
available to it in the context of resolution planning. 2In particular, the resolution plans do not
need to be announced to the credit institution or the financial group.
(2) Due to their nature, the recovery plans and the results of the resolution planning must be
treated as confidential within the meaning of section 99 (1) sentence 2 of the Code of
Administrative Court Procedure (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung).
(3) 1BaFin shall be entitled to make the information, estimates, analyses and reports that it
has received through resolution planning available to
1

the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Federal Agency for
Financial Market Stabilisation and the steering committee of the Federal Agency for
Financial Market Stabilisation,

authorities whose opinions BaFin considers necessary or helpful pursuant to section
47 e (2) sentence 3,

4

a deposit guarantee scheme or an investor compensation scheme.

2

In the cases specified in numbers 2 and 3, the conditions set out in section 9 (1) sentences
6 to 8 shall apply.

Findings and measures by BaFin pursuant to section 47b (3) and pursuant to section 47e
against a credit institution or a member of a financial group can be contested by the credit
institution or the relevant member of the financial group in question within one month of their
announcement before the Higher Administrative Court responsible for the seat of BaFin in
Frankfurt am Main. 2An objection procedure is not conducted.

(Repealed)

Division 4b

MEASURES VIS-À-VIS CREDIT INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT OF
RISKS TO THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Section 48a
Transfer order

(1) BaFin can, in accordance with the provisions set out below, order that a credit institution’s
assets, including its liabilities, be transferred to an existing legal entity (absorbing legal entity)
through spin-off.
(2) 1A transfer order may only be issued if
1

the credit institution’s viability as a going concern is jeopardised (going-concern risk),
putting the stability of the financial system at risk (systemic risk) and

2

the systemic risk as a result of the going-concern risk cannot be eliminated in an
equally safe manner in any other way than through a transfer order.

186

Section 48b
2

BaFin, the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency and the Steering Committee are also
acting in issuing and enforcing a transfer order if they may, given reasonable recognition of
the circumstances evident at the time of their action, assume that the legal basis for their
action is given. 3This is without prejudice to section 4 (4) of the Act Establishing the Federal
Financial Supervisory Authority.
(3) 1The transfer order shall be issued in agreement with the Steering Committee within the
meaning of section 4 of the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act if the transfer order
requires, or could require, financial assistance from the Restructuring Fund. 2The Steering
Committee’s decision shall be prepared by the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency.
(4) BaFin shall be justified in transmitting to the Steering Committee and the Financial Market
Stabilisation Agency any information pertinent to the decision; section 9 (1) sentence 5 shall
apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 48b
Going-concern and systemic risk
(1) 1Going-concern risk is the danger of the credit institution collapsing as a result of
insolvency if no corrective measures are taken. 2Going-concern risk is suspected if
1

the available common equity tier 1 capital pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 represents less than 90% of the required common equity tier 1 capital;

2

the available own funds pursuant to Article 72 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
represent less than 90% of the required own funds;

3

the liquid assets available to the institution in a maturity band defined through the
statutory order pursuant to section 11 (1) sentence 2 represent less than 90% of the
callable payment obligations or

4

facts are known which warrant the assumption that a shortfall pursuant to numbers 1,
2 and 3 will occur if no corrective measures are taken; this is the case, in particular, if
a loss may be anticipated based on the institution’s earnings situation, as a result of
which the conditions of numbers 1, 2 or 3 would be met.

3

If the credit institution is subject to particular own funds requirements pursuant to section 10
(3) and (4) or section 45b (1) sentence 2, these must be taken into consideration when
examining whether the conditions of sentence 2 numbers 1, 2 and 4 are met. 4The same
applies when determining whether the conditions of sentence 2 numbers 3 and 4 for
extraordinary liquidity requirements pursuant to section 11 (2) are met.
(2) 1Systemic risk is present if there is concern that the credit institution’s going-concern risk
could have a significantly negative impact on other financial sector undertakings, on the
financial markets or on the general confidence investors and other market players have in
the proper functioning of the financial system. 2Particular account shall be taken of:

187

Section 48c

1

the nature and scope of the credit institution’s liabilities to other institutions and other
financial sector undertakings,

2

the scope of the deposits received by the institution,

3

the nature, volume and composition of the risks entered into by the institution as well
as the conditions on the markets on which such positions are traded,

4

interconnectedness with other financial market participants,

5

the conditions on the financial markets, in particular the consequences which market
participants expect the institution’s collapse to have on other financial sector
undertakings, on the financial market and on the confidence investors and other
market players have in the proper functioning of the financial system,

6

the replaceability of the services and technical systems provided by the institution,

7

the complexity of the business transacted by the institution with other market
participants,

8

the nature, scope and complexity of the institution's cross-border transactions and the
replaceability of the cross-border services and technical systems.

(3) BaFin shall assess, after consulting the Deutsche Bundesbank, whether there is goingconcern and systemic risk within the meaning of subsections (1) and (2) and shall document
the joint assessment in writing.
Section 48c
Deadlines; issuing the transfer order
(1) 1Provided the risk situation permits it, BaFin can, before issuing a transfer order, set the
credit institution a deadline within which the credit institution must present a sustainable plan
indicating in what way the going-concern risk can be averted (recovery plan). 2The recovery
plan must indicate the measures that will be used to
1

avert the going-concern risk within six weeks of presenting the recovery plan
(implementation deadline) and

2

ensure capital adequacy and sufficient liquidity in the long term.

3

Where the recovery plan includes capital injections or liquidity increases, it must be credibly
demonstrated that there is a reasonable prospect of successful implementation of the
measures. 4If the institution fails to present, within the set deadline, a recovery plan which
meets the requirements of sentence 2, or if it does not credibly demonstrate the capital
injections or liquidity increases envisaged in the recovery plan, violates provisions in an
already-presented recovery plan, or if the recovery plan turns out to be unsuitable or not
capable of being implemented by the deadline, BaFin, provided the risk situation permits it,
may set the credit institution a final deadline for eliminating the going-concern risk; the
deadline to be set has to take into account the fact that the institution had already had the
opportunity to avert the going-concern risk.
188

Section 48c
(2) 1A reorganisation plan transmitted in accordance with the regulations of the Credit
Institution Reorganisation Act (Kreditinstitute-Reorganisationsgesetz) is considered to be a
recovery plan that satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) if, with due consideration of
the time schedule, there is no doubt that the reorganisation plan submitted is suitable to avert
the going-concern risk in a timely manner and that the submitted plan can be accepted,
confirmed and implemented in a timely manner. 2BaFin can order a transfer even once
reorganisation procedure has been initiated unless there is no doubt that the reorganisation
procedure is suitable to avert the going-concern risk in time and that the submitted plan can
be accepted, confirmed and implemented in a timely manner.
(3) 1The transfer order many be issued only if the absorbing legal entity agrees to the
transfer. 2The permission must make reference to a draft of the transfer order that has the
same contents and requires notarisation.
(4) If the transfer order is to specify that the credit institution should be granted capital shares
in the absorbing legal entity in return for the transfer (section 48d (1) sentence 2) and if this
requires approval from the shareholders’ meeting at the absorbing legal entity, the transfer
order cannot be issued until the required decisions have been taken by the shareholders’
meeting and can no longer be contested and potentially reversed.
(5) 1The transfer order shall not specify a legal entity as the absorbing legal entity if
1

the legal entity is not constituted in the form of a legal person,

2

the legal entity has its head office outside Germany,

3

the legal entity does not have two senior managers pursuant to the articles of
association or articles of incorporation,

4

facts are known which reveal that a senior manager is not trustworthy or does not
have the professional qualifications required to manage the institution,

5

facts are known which reveal that the holder of a major participating interest in the
legal entity or, if this is a legal person, a legal representative or representative
pursuant to the articles of association or articles of incorporation or, in the case of a
commercial partnership, a partner is not trustworthy or, for other reasons, fails to
satisfy the requirements to be set in the interests of sound and prudent management,

6

the tier 1 capital of the absorbing legal entity within the meaning of Article 26 (1)
letters (a) to (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 undershoot €5 million or

7

the object of the legal entity pursuant to the articles of association or articles of
incorporation or its assets, financial or earnings situation does not allow it to take on
the credit institution and maintain it as a going concern.

2

If the credit institution is constituted in the legal form of a corporation, the absorbing legal
entity shall be constituted in the same legal form.

189

Section 48d
(6) 1The transfer order shall be sent to the competent works council at the same time as the
credit institution is informed. 2The transfer order shall also be announced to the absorbing
legal entity. 3It must be promptly published in the electronic Federal Law Gazette. 4The
publication shall also contain information on the declaration of consent of the absorbing legal
entity and on the decisions to increase capital pursuant to subsection (4).
Section 48d
Compensation/consideration; equalisation liability
(1) 1Under the transfer order, the credit institution receives compensation if the overall value
of the items to be transferred is positive. 2Compensation consists of capital shares in the
absorbing legal entity. 3If granting shares is unreasonable for the absorbing legal entity or
risks defeating the purpose of the transfer order, compensation shall be determined in cash.
(2) 1Compensation must be proportionate to the value of the transferred assets at the time at
which the transfer order is issued. 2Any support from the restructuring fund or government
bodies that was provided or promised to avoid or overcome going-concern risk shall not be
counted in the credit institution’s favour. 3Central bank operations that are concluded at
normal terms and conditions do not represent support within the meaning of sentence 2.
(3) 1An expert selected and appointed by the court at the request of the Financial Market
Stabilisation Agency shall verify the adequacy of the compensation. 2Section 10 (1) sentence
3, subsections (2) to (5) and section 11 of the Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz)
shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3The auditor shall submit a written report on the results of his
examination. 4The audit report shall be sent to the credit institution, the absorbing legal entity,
BaFin and the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency. 5It shall conclude with a statement on
whether the compensation was appropriate at the time at which the transfer order was
issued. 6If the audit report comes to the conclusion that the compensation was adequate,
BaFin shall, in agreement with the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency, confirm the
compensation laid down in the transfer order. 7If not, it shall, in agreement with the Financial
Market Stabilisation Agency, redefine the amount of compensation within two weeks of
receiving the audit report, taking due account of the results of the report. 8The adequacy of
the newly defined compensation shall be verified pursuant to sentences 1 to 5; the auditor
who conducted the initial audit shall be considered as having been appointed to conduct this
audit.
(4) 1Where a conclusive and reliable valuation of the assets to be transferred is not possible
before the transfer order is issued, the transfer order can be based on a preliminary
valuation. 2In this case, a preliminary compensation shall be determined and the final
valuation shall be carried out at a later date. 3Section 48c (4) shall apply mutatis mutandis
subject to the proviso that the compensation must be set at double the preliminary
compensation. 4The adequacy of the preliminary compensation pursuant to subsection (3)
sentence 1 does not need to be verified. 5The final valuation shall be conducted within four
months of announcing the transfer order to the credit institution. 6In the event of transfer-back
orders pursuant to section 48j or partial transfers pursuant to section 48k, a final valuation
190

Section 48e

shall be conducted within two months of the announcement of the last order to the credit
institution without prejudice to the deadline pursuant to sentence 5. 7The compensation to be
determined based on the final valuation shall be verified pursuant to subsection (3).
(5) 1If the compensation consists of capital shares in the absorbing legal entity and the latter
must carry out a capital increase to create these capital shares, the auditor appointed
pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 shall also verify and explain whether the amount of
transferred assets equals the lowest issue price for the capital shares to be transferred. 2This
verification shall be conducted even if preliminary compensation has been determined
pursuant to subsection (4) and its adequacy is not verified. 3Once the compensation has
been confirmed pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 6, the capital increase is considered to
have been conducted.
(6) 1Where the aggregate value of the assets to be transferred is negative, the transfer order
shall stipulate that the credit institution must compensate the absorbing legal entity in cash
2
The maturity and seniority of the compensation liability shall be based on the maturity and
seniority of the liabilities involved in the spin-off. 3In the case of various maturities or seniority
levels, the ratio of the liabilities with different maturity or seniority to each other is key.
4
Subsections (2) to (4) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 48e
Contents of the transfer order
(1) The transfer order must contain at least the following information:
1

the name or the company and domicile of the absorbing legal entity,

2

the information that the entirety of the credit institution’s assets including its liabilities
shall be transferred to the absorbing legal entity,

3

the point in time as of which the actions of the transferring legal entity are considered
to have been carried out on behalf of the absorbing legal entity (spin-off cut-off date),

4

information pursuant to subsection (2) or subsection (3) on the compensation or
compensation liability

5

the proviso that individual assets, liabilities or legal relationships can be transferred
back to the credit institution conducting the spin-off by means of a special order
pursuant to section 48j (1) and (2),

6

the information that the absorbing legal entity has agreed to the transfer in the abovedescribed form.

(2) Where the transfer order stipulates that the credit institution shall be granted
compensation in the form of capital shares in the absorbing legal entity, it must contain
information
1

on the issuance and number of these capital shares in the absorbing legal entity,

191

Section 48f

2

on the aggregate value ascribed to the spun-off assets at the time at which the
transfer order was issued and on which the spin-off is based, in particular the
determination of the issuance and number of the capital shares granted to the credit
institution as compensation, and

3

on the methods and assumptions used to determine the value pursuant to number 2,
taking into consideration the provisions of section 48d (2).

(3) 1In the case of section 48d (1) sentence 3, the information pursuant to subsection (2)
number 1 shall be replaced by the level of the cash payment to be paid. 2Where an
equalisation liability is to be paid, the information pursuant to subsection (2) number 1 is to
be replaced by the amount of this liability. 3Where preliminary compensation or an
equalisation liability is laid down, the information pursuant to subsection (2) numbers 2 and 3
shall be replaced by a reference to the preliminary nature of the compensation and the
procedure used to determine the final compensation or equalisation liability.
Section 48f
Conducting the spin-off
(1) 1The spin-off is conducted for absorption based on the transfer order and the declaration
of consent of the absorbing legal entity. 2A spin-off contract, a spin-off report or a spin-off
decision on the part of the shareholders' meeting of the credit institution or the absorbing
legal entity are not required.
(2) 1The spin-off shall be based, as the closing balance sheet, on the annual balance sheet
from the credit institution’s last audited annual accounts, unless an audited balance sheet
based on a later cut-off date is available for the credit institution; to this end, BaFin may
demand that the institution provide an audited balance sheet based on a later cut-off date.
2
The annual balance sheets of the absorbing legal entity may also list, as acquisition costs
within the meaning of section 253 (1) of the Commercial Code, the values listed in the credit
institution’s closing balance sheet.
(3) 1The credit institution and the absorbing legal entity must promptly report the spin-off for
entry into the register in their respective domicile. 2Besides the closing balance sheet, a copy
of the transfer order and the notarised declaration of consent of the absorbing legal entity
pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 shall be attached to the reports.
(4) 1The entries shall be made promptly. 2The lodging of an appeal or bringing of actions
against the transfer order, the capital increase or the entry of the spin-off or the capital
increase at the absorbing legal entity shall not preclude entry.
(5) 1If the credit institution or the absorbing legal entity neglects to report for entry in a
register as stipulated under subsection (3) or is late in doing so, the Financial Market
Stabilisation Agency may submit the report on behalf of those required to register. 2In this
case, the registration cannot be conducted without the permission of the Financial Market
Stabilisation Agency.
192

Section 48g
(6) 1If the members of the management and supervisory bodies help prepare and carry out
the spin-off, this shall not represent a breach of duty towards the credit institution and its
shareholders. 2This shall be without prejudice to the obligation to pursue the institution’s
rights pursuant to section 48r (1) and (2). 3When deciding whether to lodge an appeal with a
view to preventing the issuance or the enforcement of a transfer order, the consequences
should be considered which the delay would have if the going-concern risk became public at
the same time.
Section 48g
Entry into force and effects of the spin-off
(1) The spin-off shall become effective with the announcement of the transfer order to the
credit institution and the absorbing legal entity.
(2) Once the spin-off becomes effective,
1

the assets, liabilities and legal relationships earmarked by the transfer order (spin-off
objects) are transferred to the absorbing legal entity and

2

the credit institution has a right to the compensation or compensation liability.

(3) 1Compensation in cash (section 48d (1) sentence 3) is due once the spin-off becomes
effective. 2Where the compensation is made up of capital shares in the absorbing legal entity
and a capital increase is required to create the capital shares, the absorbing legal entity must
promptly undertake the action required to have the capital increase registered and carried
out. 3Section 48f (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the registration of the capital increase.
(4) Rights similar to those of shareholders but without a voting right are, where in doubt,
adjusted to the situation created as a result of the spin-off.
(5) Section 613a of the German Civil Code shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(6) Where the absorbing legal entity does not have the authorisation to pursue the
transferred business required pursuant to section 32, the transfer order shall be regarded as
authorisation in favour of the absorbing legal entity in the scope of the authorisation granted
to the credit institution.
(7) 1Debt relationships may not be terminated for the sole reason of their transfer. 2The
transfer order and the spin-off therefore do not result in a termination of debt relationships.
3
Contractual provisions to the contrary shall be invalid. 4Sentences 1 to 3 shall not apply
1

to reasons to given notice on or terminate a debt relationship which are not limited to
the fact that the debt relationship was transferred or the preconditions for its transfer
were present,

2

to reasons to given notice on or terminate a debt relationship for reasons related to
the absorbing legal person, and

193

Section 48h

3

where the provisions of section 48k (2) sentences 1 to 3 are not fulfilled in the case of
a partial transfer.
Section 48h
Liability of the credit institution; insolvency remoteness of spin-off

(1) 1The credit institution is liable for the liabilities included in the spin-off only in the amount
of the sum which the creditor would have received had the credit institution been wound
up/resolved and no spin-off taken place. 2There is liability only if the creditor cannot obtain
satisfaction from the absorbing legal entity.
(2) The spin-off shall be without prejudice to any insolvency proceedings relating to the credit
institution's assets; it cannot be contested either within or outside of such insolvency
proceedings.
Section 48i
Objects/assets subject to foreign law
(1) Where spin-off assets are subject to foreign law under which the legal effects of the
transfer order shall not apply, the credit institution is obligated to push for the action which is,
under the foreign law, required for devolution of title to the absorbing legal entity.
(2) 1In the cases referred to in subsection (1), the institution and the absorbing legal entity
are obliged to treat the affected spin-off assets as though the devolution of title had been
conducted according to the provisions of the foreign jurisdiction. 2The credit institution
manages the affected spin-off assets for the account and in the interest of the absorbing
legal entity, whose instructions it must follow. 3The absorbing legal entity absolves the credit
institutions from any expenses incurred in this connection, while the credit institution must
pass on any proceeds from the administration of the asset to the absorbing legal entity.
(3) 1Assets whose transfer pursuant to subsection (1) the foreign jurisdiction does not
recognise do not belong to the insolvency estate in insolvency proceedings relating to the
credit institution’s assets. 2Creditors of claims against the credit institution whose transfer
pursuant to subsection (1) is not recognised by the foreign jurisdiction cannot assert their
claims against the credit institution. 3Such insolvency proceedings shall be without prejudice
to claims and obligations pursuant to subsections (1) and (2). 4Legal acts that serve to fulfil
them shall not be subject to appeal either within or outside of these insolvency proceedings.
(4) Where there is doubt as to whether the legal effects of the transfer order apply abroad,
subsections (1) to (3) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

194

Section 48j

Section 48j
Partial transfer back
(1) 1BaFin can, within four months of the spin-off becoming effective, order that individual
assets, liabilities or legal relationships (spin-off assets) be transferred back to the credit
institution conducting the spin-off (transfer-back order). 2Further transfer-back orders may be
issued within the deadline pursuant to sentence 1.
(2) 1The transfer-back order must be announced to the absorbing legal entity and the credit
institution conducting the spin-off and becomes effective once it has been announced to
both. 2Section 48f subsections (3) to (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis; a copy of the transferback order replaces the documents listed in sections 48f subsection (3) sentence 2. 3The
spin-off asset affected by a transfer-back order is considered to have remained on the books
of the credit institution conducting the spin-off from the outset.
(3) 1Spin-off assets for which financial collateral within the meaning of section 1 (17) has
been provided and the financial collateral provided for them are exempted from a transfer
back pursuant to subsection (1) subject to the provisions of subsection (5). 2Sentence 1 shall
also apply to spin-off assets incorporated in a system within the meaning of section 1 (16) or
by central banks or which are subject to an eligible netting agreement pursuant to section
196 (295) of the Solvency Regulation. 3The choice of the other spin-off assets is based on
their significance to averting the system risk emanating from the credit institution in an
effective and cost-efficient manner. 4Where they are equally significant to averting the
systemic risk emanating from the credit institution in an effective and cost-efficient manner,
the selection of liabilities is based on the ranking relevant in insolvency proceedings relating
to the credit institution’s assets. 5Sentences 3 and 4 shall also apply to the decision on an
only partial transfer back of liabilities.
(4) 1The credit institution is liable for the liabilities included in the spin-off only in the amount
of the sum which the creditor would have received had the credit institution been wound
up/resolved and no spin-off taken place. 2There is liability only if the creditor cannot obtain
satisfaction from the credit institution.
(5) 1A debt relationship which was transferred to the absorbing legal entity during
enforcement of the spin-off and which the contractual party says or claims to give notice on
or terminate in contravention of section 48g (7) can be transferred back to the credit
institution within ten business days of the absorbing legal entity receiving the declaration; any
claims that would arise from the termination of such a debt relationship are considered to be
have been transferred back along with it. 2Where the debt relationship is included in an
eligible netting agreement pursuant to articles 195, 196 and 295 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 as last amended, all debt relationships between the institution and the contractual
included in the netting agreement, the netting agreement and any claims that would result
from the application of the netting agreement shall be considered to have been transferred
back along with it. 3The same applies to framework agreements encompassing the debt
relationships included in the netting agreement. 4The deadline of four months pursuant to

195

Section 48k
subsection (1) shall not apply. 5The counterparty must be informed of the transfer back
promptly.
(6) If financial assistance from the Restructuring Fund is required, or could be required, in
connection with the transfer order, BaFin shall make the selection pursuant to subsection (3)
sentence 4 and the decision pursuant to subsection (5) in consultation with the Financial
Market Stabilisation Agency.
(7) The provisions in section 48g (2), (4) and (5) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 48k
Partial transfer
(1) 1Notwithstanding section 48e (1), the transfer order may stipulate that only part of the
assets, liabilities and legal relationships shall be transferred to the absorbing legal entity
(partial transfer). 2In this case, notwithstanding section 48e (1) number 2, the transfer order
need only list those spin-off assets that are covered by the spin-off; alternatively, it may list
those spin-off assets that will remain with the institution.
(2) 1Spin-off assets for which financial collateral has been provided within the meaning of
section 1 (17) may only be transferred together with the financial collateral, and financial
collateral may only be transferred with the spin-off assets they collateralise. 2Spin-off assets
that are included in a system within the meaning of section 1 (16) or a central bank system
may not be transferred without the collateral provided for them and collateral may not be
transferred without the spin-off assets they collateralise. 3Assets that are subject to an
eligible netting agreement pursuant to articles 195, 196 and 295 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 as last amended may only be transferred in their entirety and together with the
netting agreement and the framework agreements in which the debt relationships covered by
the netting agreements are directly or indirectly included; section 48j (5) sentence 2 shall
apply mutatis mutandis. 4Section 48j (3) sentences 3 to 5 and (6) shall apply mutatis
mutandis to the selection of the assets to be transferred.
(3) 1The absorbing legal entity is liable for liabilities not included in a transfer order pursuant
to subsection (1) only in the amount of the sum which the creditor would have received had
the credit institution been resolved and no spin-off taken place. 2There is liability only if the
creditor cannot obtain satisfaction from the credit institution.
(4) 1Where assets whose use the absorbing legal entity requires in order to maintain the
business units transferred to it as a going concern remain with the credit institution, the credit
institution must grant the absorbing legal entity sole or shared use against an appropriate fee
until the absorbing legal entity can replace the assets in question. 2Insolvency proceedings
initiated over the assets of the institution shall be without prejudice to claims pursuant to
sentence 1 or arising from a contract concluded based on an obligation pursuant to sentence
1; the conclusion of the contract and its fulfilment shall not be subject to appeal.

196

Section 48l
(5) 1BaFin can issue further transfer orders (follow-up orders) within four months of a spin-off
based on a transfer order pursuant to subsection (1) becoming effective. 2The follow-up
orders do not restart the deadline pursuant to sentence 1. 3Section 48a (3) shall apply
mutatis mutandis.
Section 48l
Measures at the credit institution
(1) 1Once the transfer order becomes effective, BaFin may revoke the credit institution's
authorisation if the credit institution is no longer able to maintain its business in line with the
provisions of this act. 2This shall be without prejudice to section 35.
(2) 1As long as the viability of the business units transferred to the absorbing legal entity as a
going concern is not jeopardised and as long as BaFin does not determine that the
restructuring goal (section 48m (1) sentence 2) at the absorbing legal entity has been
achieved, BaFin can instruct the credit institution to exercise the voting rights to which it is
entitled in the shareholders’ meeting of the absorbing legal entity in a certain manner; the
absorbing legal entity shall also be informed of these instructions. 2The institution may not be
instructed to approve
1

a capital reduction on the part of the absorbing legal entity which does not serve to
cover losses,

2

a capital increase where the issue amount or the minimum price at which the shares
will be issued is inappropriately low,

3

a merger, demerger, spin-off or asset transfer pursuant to the Transformation Act,
where the compensation or indemnity to which the institution is entitled is
inappropriately low, nor

4

the expulsion of the credit institution from the circle of shareholders.

3

Following an instruction pursuant to sentence 1 does not represent a breach of duty of the
members of authorised representative bodies towards the credit institution and its
shareholders. 4This shall be without prejudice to the obligation to pursue the credit
institution’s rights pursuant to section 48m (4) and (5) and section 48r (3).
(3) As long as the viability of the business units transferred to the absorbing legal entity as a
going concern is jeopardised and until such going-concern risk has been averted on a longterm basis, the credit institution may not, without prior written permission from BaFin, dispose
of the capital shares in the absorbing legal entity to which it is entitled.
(4) Where a petition for the initiation of insolvency proceedings over the assets of the credit
institution looks likely to be rejected for the sole reason that the credit institution's assets will
probably not cover the costs of the proceedings, the absorbing legal entity is obliged to make
the advance payment required to initiate proceedings.

197

Section 48m
(5) 1BaFin shall appoint a special auditor at the credit institution to examine whether the
credit institution can claim for damages against members of governing bodies or former
members of governing bodies for breach of due diligence standards. 2Section 45c (6) and
sections 144 and 145 of the Companies Act shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 48m
Measures at the absorbing legal entity
(1) 1On demand, the absorbing legal entity shall promptly provide BaFin with information on
all circumstances required to assess whether the business units transferred to the absorbing
legal entity can be restructured. 2The ability to restructure within the meaning of sentence 1 is
the realistic possibility of creating an assets, financial or earnings situation that ensures the
long-term competitiveness of the transferred undertaking (restructuring objective). 3Where
necessary to verify the information provided pursuant to sentence 1, BaFin may demand the
submission of documentation and surrender of copies.
(2) 1To enable or implement a transfer order, sections 7 to 7b, 7d, 7e, 8 to 11, 12 (1) to (3)
sections 14, 15 and 17 to 19 of the Financial Market Stabilisation Acceleration Act shall apply
mutatis mutandis to decisions on capital measures taken by the shareholders’ meeting of the
absorbing legal entity until BaFin determines that the restructuring objective has been
reached. 2This shall also apply if other private or public bodies make a contribution to
achieving the restructuring objective or averting the going-concern risk. 3Section 48d (2)
sentence 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
(3) 1A decision pursuant to subsection (2) shall be reported promptly to the register of the
domicile of the absorbing legal entity. 2The resolution, insofar as it is not manifestly void,
shall be entered in the commercial register without delay. 3Actions or applications for rulings
against the decision or its entry shall not preclude entry into the register. 4Section 246a (4) of
the Companies Act shall apply mutatis mutandis. 5The same applies to decisions on utilising
an authorisation to draw down approved capital created pursuant to subsection (2).
(4) 1If the institution votes in favour of a measure pursuant to subsection (2) to comply with
instructions issued by BaFin pursuant to section 48l (2), this shall not prevent action from
being brought against the decision. 2In the case of a capital increase, the action may also be
based on the fact that the issue price for the new capital shares is inappropriately low. 3In the
event of a capital reduction, the action may also be based on the fact that the capital
reduction
does
not
serve
to
offset
losses
in
the
agreed
scope.
4
Where the action is justified, but the measure has already been entered in the trade register
pursuant to subsection (3), the claim to compensation to which the institution is entitled
pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 4 shall be fulfilled by issuing capital shares provided the
damage suffered by the institution consists in an economic dilution of its capital share in the
absorbing legal entity.
(5) 1Subsections (2), (3) and (4) sentences 1 and 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to decisions
on changes to the articles of association or incorporation, the conclusion or termination of

198

Section 48m
company agreements or measures pursuant to the Transformation Act. 2Where the credit
institution, to comply with instructions pursuant to section 48l (2), votes in favour of a
measure pursuant to the Transformation Act, it may also base the action against the decision
on the fact that the compensation or indemnity granted to the institution is not appropriate.
(6) 1Where the absorbing legal entity has, in order to avert the going-concern risk or to
achieve the restructuring objective, been granted support from the Restructuring Fund or
another form of support, BaFin may, until the restructuring objective has been achieved,
1

prohibit payouts to the shareholders of the absorbing legal entity,

2

prohibit payouts to the holders of other own funds items that are, according to
contractual provisions, tied to specified targets being met provided the relevant
targets would not have been achieved without the support, or

3

prohibit payments to creditors if their claims could not, owing to a subordination
agreement, have been met following a hypothetical repayment of the support.

2

Giving notice on or buying back the affected own funds components and debt instruments
as well as balance sheet measures which could cause the objectives relevant pursuant to
sentence 1 number 2 to be achieved are also considered to be a payout within the meaning
of sentence 1. 3Where a payout is prohibited pursuant to sentence 1 number 2, the relevant
objectives are considered not to have been met. 4Sentence 1 shall not apply to payouts on
capital shares which were granted to the Restructuring Fund or the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund in connection with a support payment, and to payments on such claims of
the Restructuring Fund that were created in connection with the government support
payment. 5Section 48d (2) sentence 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 6The injection of own
funds or liquidity by private third parties in order to avert going-concern risk or achieve the
restructuring objective shall be deemed equivalent to support payments made by the
Restructuring Fund.
(7) If the restructuring objective cannot be achieved or can only be achieved at unreasonable
economic terms and if the undertaking can be resolved without jeopardising the stability of
the financial system, BaFin may, in consultation with the Financial Market Stabilisation
Agency, demand that the absorbing legal entity set up a liquidation plan showing that, and in
what way, the undertaking being maintained as a going concern by the absorbing legal entity
can be resolved in an orderly manner.
(8) BaFin may declare a liquidation plan established pursuant to subsection (7) to be binding.
(9) 1BaFin is entitled to take the measures necessary to implement a liquidation plan that is
binding pursuant to subsection (8). 2In particular, BaFin shall be authorised to issue
instructions to the absorbing legal entity. 3Where senior managers fail to guarantee proper
implementation of the plan, BaFin may, pursuant to section 45c, transfer senior managers'
powers to a special representative who is suitable to ensure proper implementation of the
plan.

199

Section 48n

Section 48n
Information
BaFin shall, pursuant to section 46d (1) and (2), notify the competent authorities in the other
EEA states that it has issued a transfer order or ordered measures pursuant to section 48l
(1) and (2) and section 48m (6) to (9).
Section 48o
Measures relating to superordinated undertakings of groups of institutions
(1) 1Where the own funds available to a group of institutions cover less than 90% of the own
funds required pursuant to Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended, an order pursuant to section 10 (3) and (4), the legal regulation pursuant to
section 51a (1), an order pursuant to section 51a (2) or section 45b (1) sentence 2,
subsection (2) or if it is to be expected that such a capital shortfall will occur if no corrective
measures are taken, BaFin may, in accordance with sections 48a to 48k, also issue a
transfer order to the superordinated undertaking. 2Sections 48l to 48n shall apply mutatis
mutandis.
(2) 1Where the viability of an institution belonging to a group or the superordinated
undertaking as a going concern is at risk and this threatens to place the viability of other
undertakings belonging to the group at risk as a going concern, BaFin may, pursuant to
sections 48c to 48k, also issue a transfer order to the superordinated undertaking, if the
danger to the other undertakings belonging to the group is associated with systemic risk.
2
Subordinated undertakings domiciled outside Germany are suspected of being at risk if
1

the own funds or liquidity requirements applicable in the country of domicile are not
met or

2

insolvency proceedings or other proceedings with similar impact provided for under
the jurisdiction of the country of domicile are imminent and cannot be averted based
on intra-group transactions without jeopardising other undertakings belonging to the
group.

3

If BaFin has issued a transfer order pursuant to sentence 1, sections 48l to 48n shall apply
mutatis mutandis.
Section 48p
Measures at financial holding groups and mixed financial holding groups
1

Where the own funds available to a financial holding group or mixed financial holding group
cover less than 90% of the own funds required pursuant to Articles 92 to 386 of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 as last amended, an order pursuant to section 10 (3) and (4), the legal
regulation pursuant to section 51a (1), an order pursuant to section 51a (2) or section 45b (1)
sentence 2, subsection (2) or if it is to be expected that such a capital shortfall will occur if no
corrective measures are taken, BaFin may, in accordance with sections 48a to 48k, also
200

Section 48q

issue a transfer order to the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company.
2
Sections 48l to 48n shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3Section 48o (2) shall apply mutatis
mutandis.
Section 48q
Measures at financial conglomerates
1

Where the own funds available to a financial conglomerate cover less than 90% of the own
funds available pursuant to section 10b (1) or if it is to be expected that such a capital
shortfall will occur if no corrective measures are taken, BaFin may, in accordance with
sections 48a to 48k, also issue a transfer order to the financial conglomerate and to the
mixed financial holding company. 2Sections 48l to 48n shall apply mutatis mutandis. 3Section
48o (2) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 48r
Legal protection
(1) 1The transfer order and the transfer-back order may be contested in the first and last
instance by the credit institution within one month before the Higher Administrative Court
responsible for the seat of BaFin in Frankfurt am Main. (2) 2The back-transfer order may be
contested in the first and last instance by the absorbing legal entity within one month before
the Higher Administrative Court responsible for the seat of BaFin in Frankfurt am Main. 3If the
back-transfer order is contested by both the credit institution and the absorbing legal entity,
the proceedings shall be merged. 4No objection procedure is carried out in either case.
5
Covenants with regard to a transfer order or back-transfer order shall not be subject to
appeal separately.
(2) 1Where it is claimed that the transfer order does not provide for adequate compensation
for the takeover of the spin-off assets by the absorbing legal entity, the action can only be
aimed at having the compensation adjusted. 2Sentence 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to
claims that the compensation liability imposed on the institution pursuant to section 48d (6) is
inappropriately high or that it should be replaced by compensation. 3If the transfer order
provided for provisional compensation and the compensation ultimately determined differs
from the provisional compensation at the expense of the absorbing legal entity, the absorbing
legal entity may also take action to have the compensation adjusted. 4Sentence 3 shall apply
mutatis mutandis for legal remedies against a judgement which adjusts the compensation to
the detriment of the absorbing legal entity.
(3) 1Subsection (1) shall apply mutatis mutandis when appealing against BaFin instructions.
2
Instructions may be rescinded for breaching the thresholds set out in section 48l (2)
sentence 2 numbers 1 to 3 only if the breach is obvious. 3Where the breach is not obvious,
the institution may demand compensation from the absorbing legal entity pursuant to section
48m (4) and (5).

201

Section 48s

(4) Subsection (1) shall apply mutatis mutandis to action against a liquidation plan being
declared binding (section 48m (8)) or against measures to implement a liquidation plan that
has been declared binding (section 48m (9)).
Section 48s
Remedying the consequences of execution; compensation
(1) 1The effectiveness of a spin-off published in the Federal Law Gazette pursuant to section
48c (6) sentence 3 shall not be affected by the fact of the Higher Administrative Court
revoking the transfer order. 2It cannot, therefore, be demanded that the consequences of
execution be remedied. 3Sentence 2 shall not apply if remedying the consequences
1

does not threaten to result in systemic risk,

2

would not threaten the legitimate interests of third parties, and

3

is not impossible.

(2) 1Where remedying the consequences of execution pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2
is impossible, the credit institution shall be entitled to compensation for the disadvantages
incurred as a result of the transfer order. 2The institution shall be entitled to this even if the
transfer order is not revoked because BaFin's actions are lawful pursuant to section 48a (2)
sentence 2 and the credit institution is not answerable for the circumstances described in this
provision.
(3) 1Subsection 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the revocation of a back-transfer order
provided that an announcement pursuant to section 48j (2) be made in place of a spin-off
published in the Federal Gazette pursuant to section 48c (6) sentence 3. 2Subsection 2 shall
apply mutatis mutandis to the revocation of a back-transfer order provided that the absorbing
legal entity and the credit institution take the place of the credit institution.
Section 48t
Measures to mitigate macroprudential or systemic risk
(1) Should the Financial Stability Committee identify changes in the intensity of
macroprudential or systemic risk within the meaning of Article 458 (2) of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the domestic financial
system and the real economy which would better be addressed by means of national
measures, BaFin, at the request of the Financial Stability Committee, can deviate for up to
two years from the following provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended
with respect to all institutions, or a group thereof, which are supervised by BaFin pursuant to
this Act or Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in order to reduce the identified changes in the
intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk by raising
1

the own funds requirements pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as
last amended,

202

Section 48t

2

the requirements for large exposures pursuant to Articles 392 and 395 to 403 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended,

3

the disclosure requirements pursuant to Articles 431 to 455 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 as last amended,

4

the capital conservation buffer pursuant to section 10c,

5

the liquidity requirements pursuant to Part 6 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last
amended, or

6

the risk weightings in the Credit Risk Standardised Approach and Internal RatingsBased Approach for residential and commercial real estate loans and for claims of
institutions and undertakings against one another within the financial sector.

(2) BaFin may impose the blanket order pursuant to subsection (1) only if
1

it has reported to the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Council,
the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the EBA
(a) the evidence of the threat to financial stability at national level pursuant to Article
458 (2) lit a to f of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including the national measures
provided for in subsection (1) implementing Article 458 (2) letter (d) of Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013 and
(b) explained why other available measures pursuant to Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU are not sufficient to counteract the threat to
financial stability at the national level, and

2

the conditions for imposing the measure pursuant to Article 458 (4) of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 are met.

(3) 1In consultation with the ESRB and the EBA, BaFin shall review the national measures
taken pursuant to subsection (1) upon expiry of the authorisation period pursuant to Article
458 (9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 2If the conditions for extending the application of the
national measures imposed pursuant to (1) are met, BaFin, at the request of the Financial
Stability Committee and pursuant to the procedure provided for in Article 458 (4) of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as last amended, can extend the national measures
repeatedly for one year by imposing a blanket order.
(4) Pursuant to Article 458 (5) to (7) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, BaFin, in consultation
with the Deutsche Bundesbank and after presenting the matter to the Financial Stability
Committee, may recognise, in whole or in part, the measures imposed by other EEA states
pursuant to Article 458 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and apply them to branches of
institutions and entities domiciled outside of Germany to which this Act is applicable pursuant
to section 52 or to branches within the meaning of section 53b pursuant to Article 458 of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(5) If the conditions under subsection (2) number 1 are met, BaFin, irrespective of the
procedure under subsections (1) and (3) and pursuant to Article 458 (4) of Regulation (EU)
203

Section 49

No 575/2013 may, for up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk no longer
exists,
1

reduce the large exposure limit pursuant to Article 395 of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 by up to 15 percent,

2

increase the risk weights for residential real estate and commercial real estate loans
in the CRSA and IRBA by up to 25 percent and

3

increase the risk weights in the CRSA for institutions' and entities' exposures to one
another within the financial sector by up to 25 percent and the risk weights in the
IRBA by 25 percent.

apportionment procedure including an appropriate estimation method, the payment deadlines
and the amount of late payment penalties, and concerning the collection shall be determined
by the Federal Ministry of Finance by way of a regulation; such regulation may also contain
provisions governing the provisional setting of the apportionment amount. 8The Federal

Section 51a

Part IV
Special provisions for housing undertakings with a saving
facility
Section 51a
Capital requirements for housing undertakings with a saving facility
(1) 1In order to meet their obligations to their creditors, and particularly in the interests of the
safety of the assets entrusted to them, housing undertakings with a saving facility must have
adequate capital. 2The Federal Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Deutsche
Bundesbank, shall be authorised by way of a statutory order that does not require the
consent of the Bundesrat, to issue more detailed provisions on the capital adequacy
(solvency) of housing undertakings with a saving facility, in particular with regard to
1

identifying the transactions subject to a capital charge for counterparty credit risk and
market risk and their risk parameters,

2

the subject and procedures relating to determining capital requirements for
operational risk,

3

the methods for calculating capital requirements and the requisite technical principles,

4

contents, type, scope and form of the information required to demonstrate adequate
own funds and provisions relating to the data storage media, transmission channels
and data formats permissible for data transmission, and

5

the requirements an external credit assessment institution has to fulfil for its ratings to
be recognised for risk weighting purposes and the requirements in terms of the rating.

3

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order, subject to the proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 4The central association representing housing undertakings with a saving
facility is to be consulted before the statutory order is issued.
(2) In determining the adequacy of capital, BaFin can order that a housing undertaking with a
saving facility must comply with capital requirements that exceed the requirements of the
statutory order pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 2, in particular,
1

in order to take into account of such risks that are not or not fully the subject of the
statutory order pursuant to section 10 (1) sentence 2,

2

if the resilience of a housing undertaking with a saving facility is not ensured,

3

in order to take due account of a particular business situation of the housing
undertaking with a saving facility, such as when taking up business operations.

4

where the housing undertaking with a saving facility does not have in place a proper
business organisation within the meaning of section 25a (1).

206

Section 51a

(3) When assessing capital adequacy, BaFin may permit, upon application from the
institution, a different method of calculating capital adequacy in order to avoid risks being
reflected inappropriately in particular cases.
(4) The calculation of the adequacy of capital in accordance with the statutory order pursuant
to subsection (1) sentence 2 shall be based on liable capital.
(5) Capital that has been, or is being, provided by third parties or by subsidiaries of the
housing undertakings with a saving facility can be recognised only if it has actually accrued
to the housing undertaking with a saving facility.
(6) 1The following shall be regarded as liable capital after deducting the positions listed in
sentence 2:
1

the amounts paid up on members' shares and the reserves; amounts paid up on the
shares of members who are retiring at the end of the financial year and their rights to
the disbursement of a share in the cooperative society's revenue reserves, as shown
separately in the balance sheet by registered cooperative societies pursuant to
section 73 (3) of the Cooperative Societies Act, shall be deducted;

2

the net profit for the financial year, insofar as its appropriation to the reserves or to the
amounts paid up on members' shares has been agreed.

2

The positions to be deducted pursuant to sentence 1 are
1

the net loss for the financial year,

2

the intangible assets,

3

the adjustment item pursuant to subsection (9),

4

securitisation positions provided the statutory order pursuant to (1) sentence 2
provides for a choice between backing the securitisation position by own funds up to
the full amount or deduction and the housing undertaking with a saving facility
chooses the deduction.

(7) 1Reserves within the meaning of subsection (6) sentence 1 comprise only the amounts
designated as such in the balance sheet in the last approved annual accounts for the end of
a financial year, with the exception of liability-side items that will be liable to tax only after
they have been released. 2Amounts designated as reserves that have been formed from
income which will become liable to tax only after a future event occurs may be counted only
up to the level of 45%. 3Reserves which are formed as a result of premium income obtained
through a share issue or through some other inflow of external funds may be included from
the time of their inflow.
(8) 1Where a housing undertaking with a saving facility draws up interim accounts, these

comparable to the annual accounts for the purposes of this provision, with interim profits
assignable to capital insofar as they are not earmarked for anticipated dividends or tax

item is defined in order to take into account capital changes which have not yet been
recognised in the balance sheet, this definition shall become null and void upon the adoption
of the next annual accounts drawn up for the end of a financial year. 3At the request of the
housing undertaking with a saving facility, BaFin shall rescind its adjustment provided the
reasons for it no longer apply.
Section 51b
Liquidity requirements for housing undertakings with a saving facility
(1) 1Housing undertakings with a saving facility must invest their funds in such a way as to
ensure that adequate liquidity is guaranteed at all times. 2Rent payments falling due in the
coming twelve months are recognised as inflows of liquidity.
(2) 1The Federal Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, shall be
authorised by way of a statutory order that does not require the consent of the Bundesrat, to
issue more detailed provisions on the adequacy of the liquidity, in particular with regard to
1

the methods for assessing liquidity adequacy and the requisite technical principles,

2

the transactions to be recognised as liquid assets and payment obligations, including
their assessment bases, as well as

3

the duty of housing undertakings with a saving facility to provide BaFin and the
Deutsche Bundesbank with the information required to demonstrate liquidity
adequacy, including provisions on the contents, nature, scope and form of the
information, on the frequency of provision thereof and on the permissible data storage
media, transmission channels and data formats.

2

The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order, subject to the proviso that the statutory order is issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. 3The central association representing housing undertakings with a saving
facility is to be consulted before the statutory order is issued.
(3) BaFin, in assessing an individual institution's liquidity, may order the housing undertaking
with a saving facility to meet liquidity requirements which go beyond the statutory order
pursuant to subsection (2) sentence 1 if long-term liquidity is not assured in the absence of
such a measure.

Section 53
Branches of undertakings domiciled outside Germany
(1) 1If an undertaking domiciled abroad maintains a branch in Germany which conducts
banking business or provides financial services, that branch shall be deemed to be a credit
institution or a financial services institution. 2If the undertaking maintains several branches in
Germany, they shall be deemed to be a single institution.
(2) This Act shall apply to the institutions specified in subsection (1) subject to the following
provisos:
1

the undertaking must appoint at least two natural persons residing in Germany who
are authorised to manage the undertaking's business and to represent it in respect of
the institution's field of business insofar as the institution conducts banking business
or provides financial services and, in providing financial services, is authorised to
obtain ownership or possession of funds or securities of customers. These persons
shall be deemed to be senior managers. Their names shall be filed for registration in
the Commercial Register.

2

the institution is obliged to keep separate books and render separate accounts to
BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank in respect of the business it conducts and the
assets of the undertaking used in its business. To this extent, the provisions of the
Commercial Code on trading books shall apply mutatis mutandis. On the liabilities
side of the annual statement of assets and liabilities, the amount of working capital
placed at the institution’s disposal by the undertaking and the amount of operating
surplus retained by the institution to bolster its own funds shall be shown separately.
210

Section 53

The amount by which the liability items exceed the asset items or by which the asset
items exceed the liability items shall be shown separately and in a single sum at the
end of the statement of assets and liabilities.
3

the statement of assets and liabilities to be drawn up for the end of each financial year
pursuant to number 2, together with a statement of income and expenses and notes
thereon, shall be deemed to constitute the annual accounts (section 26). Section 340k
of the Commercial Code shall apply mutatis mutandis to the auditing of the annual
accounts subject to the proviso that the auditor is chosen and appointed by the senior
managers. The annual accounts of the undertaking for the same financial year shall
be submitted along with the annual accounts of the institution.

4

section 33 (1) sentence 1 number 1 letter (d) shall apply mutatis mutandis to
branches that conduct both deposit and lending business. The sum total of the
amounts shown in the monthly return pursuant to section 25 as working capital placed
at the institution’s disposal by the undertaking and operating surplus retained by the
institution to bolster its own funds, less the amount of a credit balance on inter-branch
settlement account, if any, shall be deemed to constitute the institution's own funds. In
addition, capital pursuant to Article 71 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in the version
in force shall be attributed to the institution; Articles 25 to 91 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 in the version in force shall apply subject to the proviso that the own
funds pursuant to sentence 2 are deemed to be common equity tier 1 capital.

5

authorisation may also be refused if reciprocity on the basis of international
agreements is not assured. Authorisation will be revoked if and insofar as the
undertaking's authorisation to conduct banking business or provide financial services
has been revoked by the authority responsible for supervising the undertaking outside
Germany.

6

for the purposes of section 36 (1), the institution shall be deemed to be a legal
person.

7

the institution shall notify BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank without delay of the
establishment of new branches and the closure of branches in Germany.

(2a) For the provisions of this Act relating to an institution which is a subsidiary of an
undertaking domiciled outside Germany, the branch shall be deemed to be a wholly owned
subsidiary of the institution's central office domiciled outside Germany.
(3) For litigation relating to the business operations of a branch within the meaning of
subsection (1), the place of jurisdiction of the affiliate, pursuant to section 21 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, may not be contractually excluded.
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) shall not apply if they conflict with international agreements which
have been approved by the legislative bodies in the form of a Federal law.

211

Section 53a
(5) 1If a decision has been taken to wind up a branch, it will be filed for registration in the
Commercial Register of the Court relevant for the branch and all legal actions with third
parties will bear the note "in liquidation". 2The authorisation will be returned to BaFin.
(6) 1The liquidation of the branch, which must likewise be entered in the Commercial
Register, may be carried out only with BaFin's consent. 2As a rule, such consent will be
refused if the undertaking fails to provide proof that the complete business of the branch has
been wound up.
Section 53a
Representative offices of institutions domiciled outside Germany
1

An institution domiciled abroad may establish or continue a representative office in Germany
if it is authorised to conduct banking business or provide financial services in its home state
and if it has its head office there. 2The institution shall notify BaFin and the Deutsche
Bundesbank without delay of its intention to establish a representative office, as well as of
the realisation of that intention. 3BaFin will confirm to the institution the receipt of such
notification. 4The representative office, including its managers, may commence its activities
only after the institution has received the confirmation from BaFin. 5The institution shall report
the relocation or closure of the representative office to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank
without delay.
Section 53b
Undertakings domiciled in another EEA state
(1) 1A CRR credit institution or a securities trading firm domiciled in another EEA state may
conduct banking business or provide financial services in Germany, either through a branch
or by providing cross-border services, without authorisation from BaFin if the undertaking has
been granted approval by the competent authorities of the home state, the business it
conducts is covered by the approval granted and the undertaking is supervised by the
competent authorities in accordance with the directives issued by the European Union.
2
Sentence 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to CRR credit institutions which also provide
payment services within the meaning of the Payment Services Oversight Act. 3Section 53
shall not apply in this case. 4This is without prejudice to section 14 of the Industrial Code.
(2) 1BaFin will notify an undertaking within the meaning of subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2
intending to establish a branch in Germany, within two months of receipt of the documents
relating to the intended establishment of the branch transmitted by the competent authorities
of the home state, of the reports to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank prescribed for its
operations, and will specify the terms and conditions applying pursuant to subsection (3)
sentence 1, on grounds of general interest, to the performance of the operations planned by
the branch. 2After receipt of the notification from BaFin, but not later than after the expiry of
the period specified in sentence 1, the branch can be established and commence operations.
3
If an undertaking within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 intends to use tied agents,
BaFin can ask the competent authorities of the home state for their names. 4BaFin may post
212

Section 53b
corresponding information on its website. 5ESMA may, in accordance with the procedure and
under the conditions laid down in Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, request
access to this information.
(2a) BaFin will notify an undertaking within the meaning of subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2
intending to engage in operations in Germany by providing cross-border services – within
two months of receiving the documentation relating to the intended commencement of the
cross-border services transmitted by the competent authorities of the home state – of the
terms and conditions applicable pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 3 to the performance of
the planned operations on grounds of public interest.
(3) 1The following provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to branches within the meaning of
subsection (1) sentences 1 and 2 subject to the proviso that one or more branches of the

deposit insurance scheme in the institution's home country to which the institution belongs,
shall be notified to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank in writing not less than one month
before the entry into force of such changes. 3Section 3 (in the case of a CRR credit institution
or a financial services institution), sections 23a, 37, 44 (1) and sections 44c and 49 as well
as section 17 of the Act Establishing the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority shall apply

sentences 1 and 2. 4Section 23a shall not apply to operators of multilateral trading systems
who provide access to such systems in Germany by way of cross-border services.
(4) 1If BaFin ascertains that an undertaking within the meaning of subsection (1) sentences 1
and 2 is not fulfilling its obligations pursuant to subsection (3) or of Regulation (EU) No
575/2013 or that it is very likely that it will not fulfil its obligations, it will inform the competent
213

Section 53b
authorities of the home state without delay. 2If the home state fails to take any measures, or if
its measures prove to be insufficient, BaFin, after having informed the competent authorities
of the home state, may take the necessary measures; if necessary, BaFin may prohibit the
undertaking from conducting new business in Germany
(5) 1In urgent cases, BaFin may take the necessary measures before initiating the procedure
envisaged in subsection (4) pending measures by the home state within the meaning of
Article 2 of Directive 2001/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April
2001 on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions (OJ L 125/15 of 5 May 2001).
2
It will notify the European Commission, the EBA and the competent authorities of the home
state thereof without delay. 3These measures will be set aside if
1

the home state has ordered reorganisation measures within the meaning of Article 2
of Directive 2001/24/EC,

2

the home state has ordered or taken the necessary measures to ensure that the
undertaking fulfils its obligations,

3

the European Commission decided, after consulting BaFin, the home state and the
EBA, that the measures pursuant to sentence 1 are to be set aside or

4

the reason for ordering them no longer applies.

(6) The competent authorities of the home state, after having first notified BaFin, may verify
the information needed for the prudential supervision of the branch at the branch concerned,
either themselves or through their representative agents.
(7) 1An undertaking domiciled in another EEA state which conducts banking business within
the meaning of section 1 (1) sentence 2 numbers 1 to 3, 5 and 7 to 9, provides financial
services within the meaning of section 1 (1a) sentence 2 numbers 7, 9 and 10 or provides
payment services within the meaning of the Payment Services Oversight Act or operates as
a financial undertaking within the meaning of section 1 (3) may conduct these operations,
notwithstanding section 32, without authorisation from BaFin through a branch or by
providing cross-border services in Germany if
1

the undertaking is a subsidiary of a CRR credit institution or a joint subsidiary of
several CRR credit institutions,

2

its articles of association or articles of incorporation permit such operations,

3

the parent undertaking(s) is (are) authorised to operate as a CRR credit institution in
the state in which the undertaking is domiciled,

4

the operations performed by the undertaking are likewise conducted in the home
state,

5

the parent undertaking(s) hold(s) at least 90 per cent of the voting rights in the
subsidiary,

214

Section 53b

6

the parent undertaking(s) has (have) submitted convincing evidence of the prudent
management of the undertaking to the competent authorities of the undertaking's
home state and, with the consent of these competent authorities of the home state,
has (have) jointly and severally guaranteed the obligations incurred by the subsidiary,
and

7

the undertaking is included in the supervision of the parent undertaking on a
consolidated basis.

2

Sentence 1 shall apply as appropriate to subsidiaries of undertakings, financial holding
companies, mixed financial holding companies and mixed-activity holding companies
specified in sentence 1 which satisfy the aforementioned conditions. 3Subsections (2) to (6)
shall apply mutatis mutandis.

(8) 1BaFin may request that a domestic branch of an institution domiciled in another EEA
state be regarded as significant. 2If the institution belongs to a group of institutions, financial
holding group or mixed financial holding group headed by an EU parent institution or an EU
parent financial holding company or a mixed EU parent financial holding company, BaFin will
submit the request to the authority responsible for the supervision of the group on a
consolidated basis; otherwise, it will submit such request to the competent authority of the
home state. 3The request must be substantiated. 4A branch shall be regarded as significant,
in particular, if
1

its market share in terms of deposits exceeds 2%,

2

if a suspension or closure of the operations of the institution would likely have an
impact on systemic liquidity and the payment, clearing and settlement systems in the
host member state or

3

if the branch has a certain size and the importance in terms of number of clients
within the context of the banking or financial system.

5

Bafin may require the institutions pursuant to sentence 1 to submit all the information
necessary for making the assessment pursuant to sentence 4.
(9) 1If BaFin, the competent authority of the home state as well as, if appropriate, the
authority responsible for the supervision of the group on a consolidated basis do not reach a
unanimous decision about classifying the branch as significant within two months of receipt
of the application, BaFin will itself decide – taking into consideration the opinions and
reservations of the other competent authority – within a further two months about the
classification of a branch as significant. 2The other competent authorities shall be notified of
this decision in writing, stating the reasons therefor. 3If, by the expiry of the period specified
in sentence 1, BaFin or a competent authority domiciled in another state of the EEA requests
assistance from the EBA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, BaFin will
defer its decision pursuant to sentence 1 and await a decision by the EBA in accordance with
Article 19 (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and will then reach a decision that is

215

Section 53c
consistent with it. 4The EEA can no longer be requested to provide assistance after the end
of the two-month period, or after a joint decision has been reached.
(10) 1If BaFin is responsible for supervision of subsidiaries of an EU parent credit institution
or a EU parent financial holding company or an EU parent mixed financial holding company
on an individual or sub-consolidated basis, for the consolidated supervision of which it is not
responsible, and if no joint decision is reached by all the competent authorities about the
amount of the own funds and the necessity for additional own funds requirements within the
four-month period, BaFin will decide on its own whether the amount of own funds of the
subsidiaries subject to its supervision is appropriate and whether additional own funds
requirements will be necessary. 2In reaching its decision BaFin will duly take into account the
opinions and reservations of the competent authority which carries out the supervision on a
consolidated basis of the group of institutions, the financial holding group or the mixed
financial holding group; the decision must take into account the risk assessment as well as
the opinions and reservations which the other competent authorities have expressed during
the four-month period. 3If, by the expiry of the period specified in section 8a (4) sentence 1,
BaFin or a competent authority domiciled in another EEA state requests assistance from the
EBA pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, BaFin will defer its decision
pursuant to sentence 1 and await a decision by the EBA in accordance with Article 19 (3) of
Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and will then reach a decision that is consistent with it. 4The
EEA shall not be requested to provide assistance after the end of the four-month period, or
after a joint decision has been reached. 5BaFin will send its decision in writing, stating the
reasons therefor, to the competent authority which carries out the supervision on a
consolidated basis of the group of institutions, the financial holding group or the mixed
financial holding group. 6Where the EBA was consulted, BaFin will take its comment into
account and explain any significant deviation therefrom.
(11) 1Before BaFin orders an inspection pursuant to section 44 of a branch operating in
Germany, it must consult the competent authorities of the home state. 2The information and
findings that are gained from the examination shall be communicated to the competent
authorities of the home state if they are relevant for the risk assessment of the parent
institution or for the stability of the financial system in the home state.
Section 53c
Undertakings domiciled in a non-EEA state
The Federal Ministry of Finance shall be authorised, by way of a statutory order,
1

to stipulate that the provisions of this Act concerning foreign undertakings domiciled in
another EEA state will likewise be applied to undertakings domiciled in a non-EEA
state insofar as this is necessary in the context of the right of establishment or of
service transactions or for supervision on a consolidated basis by virtue of
agreements of the European Communities with non-EEA states;

216

Section 53d

2

to order that the provisions of section 53b be applied in full or in part, with full or
partial exemption from the provisions of section 53, to undertakings domiciled in a
non-EEA state if reciprocity is assured and if
(a) the undertakings are supervised in their country of domicile in the areas covered
by the exemption in accordance with internationally recognised principles,
(b) branches of corresponding undertakings domiciled in Germany are afforded
comparable exemptions in that state, and
(c) the competent authorities of the country of domicile are willing to cooperate
satisfactorily with BaFin and if this is guaranteed by means of an international
agreement.
Section 53d
Parent undertakings domiciled in a non-EEA state

(1) If deposit-taking credit institutions, e-money institutions or securities trading firms
domiciled in Germany, which are subsidiaries of either an institution or a financial holding
company domiciled in a non-EEA state, are not subject to a level of supervision in that nonEEA state which is equivalent to the provisions of this Act relating to supervision on a
consolidated basis, BaFin can define the group of undertakings as a group of institutions or a
financial holding group and an institution as a superordinated undertaking; the provisions of
this Act relating to supervision on a consolidated basis shall apply mutatis mutandis in this
case. 2Before reaching a decision on the equivalence of the supervision pursuant to
sentence 1, BaFin will consult the EBA.
(2) (Repealed)
(3) 1Notwithstanding subsection (1) and section 15 (2) of the of the Supervision of Financial
Conglomerates Act, BaFin can in individual cases ensure appropriate supervision on a
consolidated basis in other ways. 2In particular, BaFin can request that a financial holding
company or a mixed financial holding company domiciled in Germany or in another EEA
state be established, to which the provisions of this Act relating to supervision on a
consolidated basis shall apply mutatis mutandis.
4) 1In the cases specified in subsection (3), BaFin will inform the competent authorities of the
home state of the procedure chosen. 2This is without prejudice to the duties pursuant to
section 7a (2) number 3 and section 7b (3) number 2.

submission of summary reports and lists

insofar as this is necessary for the fulfilment of BaFin's tasks, in particular to enable it to
obtain consistent records for assessing the clearing carried out by the central counterparties.
2
The Federal Ministry of Finance may delegate this authority to BaFin by way of a statutory
order provided that the statutory order is to be issued in agreement with the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
Section 53k
Outsourcing of activities and processes
If a central counterparty outsources activities and processes pursuant to Article 35 of
Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, Article 25b (3) sentences 1 and 2 and subsection (4) shall
apply mutatis mutandis.
Section 53l
Power to issue orders; measures in the case of organisational deficiencies
(1) 1In individual cases, BaFin may issue orders to a central counterparty which are
appropriate and necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU)
No 648/2012. 2In particular, to ensure a proper business organisation is in place, and to

220

Section 53m

ensure compliance with the organisational requirements and the requirements pursuant to
Articles 26, 28, 29, 31 (1) sentence 2 as well as Articles 33 to 35 of Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, it may order that a central counterparty
1

must take measures to reduce risks insofar as they arise from certain types of
transactions and products or through the use of certain systems or from the
outsourcing of activities and processes to another undertaking, or

2

may not engage in certain types of business or services, or may engage in such types
of business or services only to a limited extent.

(2) BaFin may, instead of the measures named in subsection (1) sentence 2 or together with
these measures order that the central counterparty comply with own funds requirements
which go beyond the requirements pursuant to Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, where appropriate in conjunction with regulatory technical standards pursuant to
subsection (3) of same.
Section 53m

approval.
Section 53n
Measures to improve the financial resources and the liquidity of a central counterparty
authorised pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012
(1) 1If the assets and liabilities, financial position or profitability of a central counterparty or
other circumstances justify the assumption that the central counterparty will not be able to
sustainably fulfil the requirements of Articles 41, 42, 43, 44, 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) No
648/2012, in each case in conjunction with the regulatory technical standards adopted to
concretise these requirements, BaFin may order the central counterparty to take measures to
improve the adequacy of its own funds and liquidity, in particular
1

to transmit a well-founded description of the development of the key business
activities over a period of at least three years, including projected balance sheets and
projected profit and loss accounts,

2

to review measures for improving protection against or reducing the major risks
identified by the central counterparty and the associated risk concentrations and to
report this to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank, whereby concepts for exiting from
individual business areas or severing parts of the central counterparty should also be
reported,

3

to report on suitable measures to ensure compliance with the margin requirements,
the size of the default fund, the other financial resources, the liquidity, the collateral
requirements and the investment policy, or

4

to present to BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank a concept for averting a potentially
dangerous situation within the meaning of section 35 (2) number 4.

2

The assumption that the central counterparty will not be able to sustainably comply with the
requirements is routinely justified if
1

the margin payments
(a) are not sufficient on at least one day in two reporting periods pursuant to section
53j (1) within one calendar year to cover the losses that result from at least 99 %
of the exposures movements over the time horizon specified under Article 41 (1)
of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, also in conjunction with regulatory technical
standards referred to in paragraph (5) thereof, or
(b) do not fully hedge, at least on a daily basis, all exposures with all its clearing
members and the other central counterparties with which it has interoperability
arrangements,

222

Section 53n

2

the default fund does not reach the minimum amount referred to in Article 41 (1)
sentence 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in two reporting periods pursuant to
section 53j (1),

3

the default fund and the other financial resources are not sufficient on two reporting
dates pursuant to section 53j (1) within one calendar year to cover a default of the two
clearing members referred to in Article 43 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,

4

the credit lines or similar arrangements which exist to cover the liquidity needs
referred to in Article 44 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, also in conjunction with
regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph (2) thereof, are not sufficient
on two reporting dates pursuant to section 53j (1) to cover the liquidity risk with regard
to the default of at least the two clearing members to which the central counterparty
has the largest exposures.

5

the central counterparty has in two reporting periods pursuant to section 53j (1)
accepted in each case more than 3% of the overall collateral without taking into
account the requirements referred to in Article 46 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
also in conjunction with regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph (3)
thereof or

6

the central counterparty has in two reporting periods pursuant to section 53j (1)
invested in each case more than 3% of the overall collateral without taking into
account the requirements referred to in Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
also in conjunction with regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph (8)
thereof.

(2) In place of the measures pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 or in conjunction with
these measures, BaFin may order the adoption of measures pursuant to subsection (3)
sentence 1 numbers 1 to 7 if the measures pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 do not
provide sufficient assurance of sustainably ensuring compliance with the requirements
pursuant to Articles 41, 42, 43, 44, 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, in each case
also in conjunction with the technical regulation standards adopted to concretise these
requirements; subsection (4) shall thus apply mutatis mutandis.
(3) 1If in the case of a central counterparty the financial resources do not comply with the
requirements pursuant to Articles 41, 42 or 43 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, in each case
also in conjunction with the technical regulation standards adopted to concretise these
requirements, or the requirements pursuant to section 45b (1) sentence 2, the liquidity does
not comply with the requirements pursuant to Article 44 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012,
also in conjunction with regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph (2) thereof,
the collateral received does not comply with the requirements pursuant to Article 46 of
Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, also in conjunction with regulatory technical standards
referred to in paragraph (3) thereof or the investment of the financial resources does not
comply with the requirements pursuant to Article 47 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, also in
conjunction with regulatory technical standards referred to in subsection (8) thereof, BaFin
may
223

Section 53n

1

prohibit or limit both withdrawals by the proprietors or partners and the distribution of
profits,

2

prohibit or limit balance sheet measures that serve to offset an existing annual loss or
to show a balance sheet profit,

3

order that the distribution of all types of disbursements on own funds instruments
apart from those pursuant to section 10 (5a) be dispensed with fully or in part and
without replacement if they are not fully covered by an existing annual profit,

4

order the institution to take measures to reduce risks insofar as they arise from certain
types of activities and products or through the use of certain systems,

5

prohibit or limit variable components of compensation to a certain proportion of the
profit for the year; this does not apply to variable components of compensation
established in a collective wage agreement or within its scope of application through
an agreement of the contracting parties on the application of the provisions of the
collective wage agreement or on the basis of a collective wage agreement in a plantlevel or sectoral labour agreement,

6

order the central counterparty to limit the total annual amount designated for the
variable remuneration of all senior managers and employees (total amount of variable
remuneration) to a certain proportion of the profit for the year or to completely cancel
it; this does not apply to variable components of remuneration established in a
collective wage agreement or within its scope of application through an agreement of
the contracting parties on the application of the provisions of the collective wage
agreement or on the basis of a collective wage agreement in a plant-level or service
agreement, or

7

order that the central counterparty explain how and in what period of time its financial
resources or its liquidity is to be sustainably restored (the central counterparty's
restructuring plan) and that BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank are to be regularly
informed of the progress of these measures.

2

The restructuring plan pursuant to sentence 1 number 7 must be transparent, plausible and
justified. 3The plan must name concrete aims, interim targets and deadlines for the
implementation of the measures described, which can be monitored by BaFin. 4BaFin can, at
any time, inspect the central counterparty's restructuring plan and the associated documents.
5
BaFin can demand that the central counterparty's restructuring plan be amended and
impose specifications in this regard if it considers the stated objectives, interim target and
implementation deadlines to be insufficient or if the central counterparty does not adhere to
them.
(4) 1BaFin may issue the orders specified in subsection (3) only if the central counterparty
has failed to remedy the deficiency within a period to be set by BaFin. 2If this is required to
prevent a foreseeable short-term deterioration in the financial resources or the liquidity of the
central counterparty or if measures pursuant to subsection (1) sentence 1 have already been
taken, such orders are permissible even without prior warning with the setting of a deadline.

224

Section 53n
3

Decisions on the distribution of profits shall be invalid insofar as they contradict an order
issued pursuant to subsection (3). 4If provisions in contracts on own funds instruments
contradict an order issued pursuant to subsection (3), no rights can be derived from them. 5At
the same time as or subsequent to prohibiting the payment of variable components of
remuneration pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 number 5, BaFin can order that
entitlements to confer variable remuneration components are rendered completely or partly
invalid if
1

the central counterparty at the same time as or subsequent to prohibiting the payment
makes use of financial assistance from the Restructuring Fund or the Financial
Market Stabilisation Fund and, in the event of a subsequent order, the preconditions
for the prohibition of the payment have by this point in time not ceased to apply, or
have ceased to apply only on the basis of said assistance,

2.

an order by BaFin pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 numbers 1 to 4, 6 or 7 is
issued or is already in place after payment has been prohibited or

3

measures pursuant to section 46 or pursuant to section 48a are taken at the time the
payment is prohibited or thereafter.

6

An order pursuant to sentence 5 may be also issued, in particular, if
1

the entitlements to grant variable remuneration were created on the basis of
provisions of a central counterparty's remuneration system which contradict the
prudential requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for suitable and transparent
remuneration systems geared towards the central counterparty’s sustainable
development, or

2

it is to be assumed that without the granting of financial assistance by the
Restructuring Fund or the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund the central counterparty
would not have been in a position to grant the variable remuneration components; if it
is to be assumed that the central counterparty would have been able to grant some of
the variable remuneration components, the variable remuneration components are to
be cut commensurately.

7

Sentences 5 and 6 shall not apply if the entitlements to grant variable remuneration came
into existence before 16 February 2013. 8Central counterparties must take account of the
power to issue orders pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 number 6 and the provision in
sentence 1 in corresponding contractual agreements with their senior management and staff
members. 9If contractual agreements on the granting of variable remuneration run counter to
an order pursuant to subsection (3) sentence 1 number 5 or 6, no rights can be derived from
them.

(2) 1If, in criminal proceedings, facts become otherwise known which point to irregularities in
an institution's business operations, and if the transmitting agency believes that these need
to be made known to BaFin so that it can take measures pursuant to this Act, the court, the
criminal prosecution authority or the penal enforcement authority will likewise transmit these

granting access to the files that protecting the interests of the party concerned should take

this Act, the statutory orders issued in connection with it or the provisions of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013, and any decision on an administrative pecuniary penalty that has become nonappealable pursuant to subsections (2) to (4), and in doing so will also provide information on
the type and nature of the breach. 2This shall be without prejudice to BaFin’s rights pursuant
to section 37 (1) sentence 3.
(2) Publication of a decision on an administrative pecuniary penalty that has become nonappealable pursuant to section 56 (4c) may not contain any personal data.

Republic of Germany or one or more signatory states to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area or if such publication would cause disproportionate damage to the institutions
or natural persons involved.
(4) 1BaFin will publish on an anonymous basis a measure that has become legally
enforceable or a decision on an administrative pecuniary penalty that has become nonappealable with the exception of decisions on administrative pecuniary penalties pursuant to
section 56 (4c) where publication pursuant to subsection (1)
1

injures the personal rights of natural persons or publication of personal data would be
disproportionate for other reasons,

2

would seriously jeopardise the stability of the financial markets of the Federal
Republic of Germany or one or more EEA states or the continuation of a criminal
investigation, or

3

would cause disproportionate damage to the institutions or natural persons involved.

2

Notwithstanding sentence 1, BaFin may, in the cases referred to in sentence 1 numbers 2
and 3, postpone publication pursuant to subsection (1) until such time as the reasons for
publication on an anonymous basis no longer exist.
(5) The measures and decisions on administrative pecuniary penalties within the meaning of
subsection (1) with the exception of decisions on administrative pecuniary penalties pursuant
to section 56 (4c) shall remain published on BaFin's website for at least five years from when
the measure becomes legally enforceable or when the decision on an administrative
pecuniary penalty becomes non-appealable.
