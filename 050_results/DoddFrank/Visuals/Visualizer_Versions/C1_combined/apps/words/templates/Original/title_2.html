<div class = "ex9">(II) a transfer is made when such transfer is so perfected that a bona fide purchaser from the covered financial company against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the property transferred that is superior to the interest in such property of the transferee, but if such transfer is not so perfected before the date on which the Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered financial company, such transfer is made immediately before the date of such appointment; and 
</div>

<div class = "ex10">(aa) after the 90-day period preceding the date on which the Corporation was appointed as receiver for the covered financial company; and
