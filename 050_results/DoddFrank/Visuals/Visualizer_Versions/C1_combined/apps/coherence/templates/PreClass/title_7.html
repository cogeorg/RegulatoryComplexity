</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(B) Timing. 
<div class = "ex8">"(i) Exempt commodities. For exempt commodities, the limits required under subparagraph (A) shall be established within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this paragraph.

</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(E) Other material factors. Such other material factors as the Commission specifies by rule or regulation as relevant to determine whether a swap serves a significant price discovery function with respect to a regulated market.

<div class = "ex6">"(5) Economically equivalent contracts. 
<div class = "ex7">"(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commission shall establish limits on the amount of positions, including aggregate position limits, as appropriate, other than bona fide hedge positions, that may be held by any person with respect to swaps that are economically equivalent to contracts of sale for future delivery or to options on the contracts or commodities traded on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market subject to paragraph (2).

<div class = "ex7">"(B) In establishing limits pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commission shall
