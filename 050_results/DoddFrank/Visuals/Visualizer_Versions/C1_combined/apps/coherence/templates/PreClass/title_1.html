</div>
<div class = "ex4">SEC. 115. Enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and certain bank holding companies. 
<div class = "ex5">(a) In general. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) Purpose. In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress, failure, or ongoing activities of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors concerning the establishment and refinement of prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and large, interconnected bank holding companies, that 
<div class = "ex7">(A) are more stringent than those applicable to other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3). 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Recommended application of required standards. In making recommendations under this section, the Council may 
<div class = "ex7">(A) differentiate among companies that are subject to heightened standards on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate; or 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) recommend an asset threshold that is higher than $50,000,000,000 for the application of any standard described in subsections (c) through (g). 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Development of prudential standards. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) In general. The recommendations of the Council under subsection (a) may include 
<div class = "ex7">(A) risk-based capital requirements;

</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Prudential standards for foreign financial companies. In making recommendations concerning the standards set forth in paragraph (1) that would apply to foreign nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding companies, the Council shall 
<div class = "ex7">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign nonbank financial company or foreign-based bank holding company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Considerations. In making recommendations concerning prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Council shall 
<div class = "ex7">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on 
<div class = "ex8">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 113; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iv) any other factors that the Council determines appropriate; 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under section 165; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(C) adapt its recommendations as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate. 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(c) Contingent capital. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) Study required. The Council shall conduct a study of the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent capital requirement for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), which study shall include 
<div class = "ex7">(A) an evaluation of the degree to which such requirement would enhance the safety and soundness of companies subject to the requirement, promote the financial stability of the United States, and reduce risks to United States taxpayers; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) an evaluation of the characteristics and amounts of contingent capital that should be required; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(C) an analysis of potential prudential standards that should be used to determine whether the contingent capital of a company would be converted to equity in times of financial stress; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(D) an evaluation of the costs to companies, the effects on the structure and operation of credit and other financial markets, and other economic effects of requiring contingent capital; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(E) an evaluation of the effects of such requirement on the international competitiveness of companies subject to the requirement and the prospects for international coordination in establishing such requirement; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(F) recommendations for implementing regulations. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Report. The Council shall submit a report to Congress regarding the study required by paragraph (1) not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Recommendations. 
<div class = "ex7">(A) In general. Subsequent to submitting a report to Congress under paragraph (2), the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and any bank holding company described in subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) Factors to consider. In making recommendations under this subsection, the Council shall consider 
<div class = "ex8">(i) an appropriate transition period for implementation of a conversion under this subsection; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) the factors described in subsection (b)(3); 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iii) capital requirements applicable to a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), and subsidiaries thereof; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iv) results of the study required by paragraph (1); and 
</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(d) Resolution plan and credit exposure reports.

</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) the nature and extent to which other such significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company. 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(e) Concentration limits. In order to limit the risks that the failure of any individual company could pose to nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors or bank holding companies described in subsection (a), the Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to prescribe standards to limit such risks, as set forth in section 165. 
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(f) Enhanced public disclosures. The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require periodic public disclosures by bank holding companies described in subsection (a) and by nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors, in order to support market evaluation of the risk profile, capital adequacy, and risk management capabilities thereof. 
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(g) Short-term debt limits. The Council may make recommendations to the Board of Governors to require short-term debt limits to mitigate the risks that an over-accumulation of such debt could pose to bank holding companies described in subsection (a), nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors, or the financial system. 
</div>
</div>

<div class = "ex6">(2) Use of examination reports and information. For purposes of this subsection, the Board of Governors shall, to the fullest extent possible, rely on reports of examination of any subsidiary depository institution or functionally regulated subsidiary made by the primary financial regulatory agency for that subsidiary, and on information described in subsection (a)(2). 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(c) Coordination with primary financial regulatory agency. The Board of Governors shall 
<div class = "ex6">(1) provide reasonable notice to, and consult with, the primary financial regulatory agency for any subsidiary before requiring a report or commencing an examination of such subsidiary under this section; and

</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Enforcement authority for functionally regulated subsidiaries.

The recommendation shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the concerns giving rise to the recommendation. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Back-up authority of the Board of Governors. If, during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the primary financial regulatory agency receives a recommendation under paragraph (1), the primary financial regulatory agency does not take supervisory or enforcement action against a subsidiary that is acceptable to the Board of Governors, the Board of Governors (upon a vote of its members) may take the recommended supervisory or enforcement action, as if the subsidiary were a bank holding company subject to supervision by the Board of Governors. 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex4">SEC. 163. Acquisitions.

For purposes of section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1842), a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors shall be deemed to be, and shall be treated as, a bank holding company. 
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Acquisition of nonbank companies. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) Prior notice for large acquisitions. Notwithstanding section 4(k)(6)(B) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)(6)(B)), a bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors shall not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company (other than an insured depository institution) that is engaged in activities described in section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 having total consolidated assets of $10,000,000,000 or more, without providing written notice to the Board of Governors in advance of the transaction. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Exemptions. The prior notice requirement in paragraph (1) shall not apply with regard to the acquisition of shares that would qualify for the exemptions in section 4(c) or section 4(k)(4)(E) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843(c) and (k)(4)(E)). 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Notice procedures. The notice procedures set forth in section 4(j)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843(j)(1)), without regard to section 4(j)(3) of that Act, shall apply to an acquisition of any company (other than an insured depository institution) by a bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors, as described in paragraph (1), including any such company engaged in activities described in section 4(k) of that Act.

<div class = "ex6">(4) Standards for review. In addition to the standards provided in section 4(j)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843(j)(2)), the Board of Governors shall consider the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to global or United States financial stability or the United States economy. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(5) Hart-Scott-Rodino filing requirement. Solely for purposes of section 7A(c)(8) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a(c)(8)), the transactions subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) shall be treated as if Board of Governors approval is not required. 
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex4">SEC. 165. Enhanced supervision and prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and certain bank holding companies. 
<div class = "ex5">(a) In general. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) Purpose. In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to recommendations by the Council under section 115, establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50,000,000,000 that 
<div class = "ex7">(A) are more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3). 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Tailored application. 
<div class = "ex7">(A) In general. In prescribing more stringent prudential standards under this section, the Board of Governors may, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 115, differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) Adjustment of threshold for application of certain standards. The Board of Governors may, pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 115, establish an asset threshold above $50,000,000,000 for the application of any standard established under subsections (c) through (g). 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Development of prudential standards. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) In general. 
<div class = "ex7">(A) Required standards. The Board of Governors shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that shall include 
<div class = "ex8">(i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, determines that such requirements are not appropriate for a company subject to more stringent prudential standards because of the activities of such company (such as investment company activities or assets under management) or structure, in which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other standards that result in similarly stringent risk controls; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) liquidity requirements; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iii) overall risk management requirements; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iv) resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(v) concentration limits. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) Additional standards authorized. The Board of Governors may establish additional prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that include 
<div class = "ex8">(i) a contingent capital requirement; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) enhanced public disclosures; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iii) short-term debt limits; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iv) such other prudential standards as the Board or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation made by the Council in accordance with section 115, determines are appropriate. 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Standards for foreign financial companies. In applying the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of Governors shall 
<div class = "ex7">(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Considerations. In prescribing prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall 
<div class = "ex7">(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on 
<div class = "ex8">(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 113; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(iv) any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors determines appropriate; 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 113 would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under paragraph (1) of this subsection; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(C) take into account any recommendations of the Council under section 115; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(4) Consultation. Before imposing prudential standards or any other requirements pursuant to this section, including notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices, that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with each Council member that primarily supervises any such subsidiary with respect to any such standard or requirement. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(5) Report. The Board of Governors shall submit an annual report to Congress regarding the implementation of the prudential standards required pursuant to paragraph (1), including the use of such standards to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(c) Contingent capital. 
<div class = "ex6">(1) In general.

</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Factors to consider. In issuing regulations under this subsection, the Board of Governors shall consider

</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) Credit exposure report. The Board of Governors shall require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, and the Corporation on

<div class = "ex7">(B) the nature and extent to which other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Review. The Board of Governors and the Corporation shall review the information provided in accordance with this subsection by each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a). 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(4) Notice of deficiencies. If the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly determine, based on their review under paragraph (3), that the resolution plan of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the company under title 11, United States Code 
<div class = "ex7">(A) the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall notify the company of the deficiencies in the resolution plan; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) the company shall resubmit the resolution plan within a timeframe determined by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, with revisions demonstrating that the plan is credible and would result in an orderly resolution under title 11, United States Code, including any proposed changes in business operations and corporate structure to facilitate implementation of the plan.

</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) Divestiture. The Board of Governors and the Corporation, in consultation with the Council, may jointly direct a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), by order, to divest certain assets or operations identified by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, to facilitate an orderly resolution of such company under title 11, United States Code, in the event of the failure of such company, in any case in which 
<div class = "ex8">(i) the Board of Governors and the Corporation have jointly imposed more stringent requirements on the company pursuant to subparagraph (A); and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">(ii) the company has failed, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of the imposition of such requirements under subparagraph (A), to resubmit the resolution plan with such revisions as were required under paragraph (4)(B). 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(6) No limiting effect. A resolution plan submitted in accordance with this subsection shall not be binding on a bankruptcy court, a receiver appointed under title II, or any other authority that is authorized or required to resolve the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board, any bank holding company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the foregoing.

</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Credit exposure. For purposes of paragraph (2), "credit exposure" to a company means 
<div class = "ex7">(A) all extensions of credit to the company, including loans, deposits, and lines of credit; 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">(B) all repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the company, and all securities borrowing and lending transactions with the company, to the extent that such transactions create credit exposure for the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a);

<div class = "ex7">(B) Necessary actions. Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board of Governors shall require a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors to establish an intermediate holding company if the Board of Governors makes a determination that the establishment of such intermediate holding company is necessary to
