<div class = "ex4">SEC. 1491. Sense of Congress regarding the importance of government-sponsored enterprises reform to enhance the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage <span class="D"> credit. </span> 
<div class = "ex5">(a) Findings. The Congress finds as follows: 
<div class = "ex6">(1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage <span class="D"> Corporation </span> (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned <span class="D"> corporations </span> with Government mandated affordable housing goals. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development required that 42 percent of Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels below the median for a given area. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their overall mortgage <span class="D"> purchases </span> by 2008, and additionally mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage <span class="D"> purchases </span> by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be "special affordable" loans made to borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an areas median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals, in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to <span class="D"> purchase </span> subprime securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(5) After this authorization to <span class="D"> purchase </span> subprime securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 percent to 32.7 percent over the same period. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie Maes acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down <span class="D"> payments </span> almost tripled. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(7) According to data from the <span class="R"> Federal Housing Finance Agency </span> (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United <span class="D"> States </span> and have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United <span class="D"> States. </span> 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury Department subsequently agreeing to <span class="D"> purchase </span> at least $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in exchange for warrants for the <span class="D"> purchase </span> of 79.9 percent of each enterprises common stock. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 worth of risk. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that <span class="D"> consumers </span> are offered and receive <span class="D"> residential mortgage loans </span> on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Sense of the Congress. It is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage <span class="D"> credit </span> and the practices related to such <span class="D"> credit </span> would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
