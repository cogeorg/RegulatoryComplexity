<div class = "ex4">SEC. 931. Findings. 
<div class = "ex5">Congress finds the following: 
<div class = "ex6">(1) Because of the <span class="D"> systemic importance </span> of <span class="D"> credit </span> ratings and the reliance placed on <span class="D"> credit </span> ratings by individual and institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities and performances of <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies, <span class="D"> including </span> <span class="D"> nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, </span> are matters of national public interest, as <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies are central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United <span class="D"> States </span> economy. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) <span class="D"> Credit </span> rating agencies, <span class="D"> including </span> <span class="D"> nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, </span> play a critical "gatekeeper" role in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public oversight and accountability. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) Because <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other financial "gatekeepers" do, the activities of <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(4) In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers of structured <span class="D"> financial products </span> on potential ratings of such products, <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies face conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give clearer authority to the <span class="R"> Securities and Exchange Commission. </span> 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured <span class="D"> financial products </span> have proven to be inaccurate. This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by <span class="D"> financial institutions </span> and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the economy in the United <span class="D"> States </span> and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part of <span class="D"> credit </span> rating agencies.
