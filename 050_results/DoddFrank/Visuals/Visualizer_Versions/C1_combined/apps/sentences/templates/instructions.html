<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p> Classify the logical parts of a sentence. </p>
<ul>
    <li> <span class=A1> Antecedent L1:</span> antecedent parts describe cases in which the law can be applied. L1 stands for first layer. </li>
    <li> <span class=A2> Antecedent L2:</span> are antecendent parts that further describe an antecendent part. L2 stands for second layer. </li>
    <li> <span class=A3> Antecedent L3:</span> are antecendent parts of layer 3. </li>
    <li> <span class=C>Consequent:</span> consequent parts describe the provision of the law. </li>
    <li> <span class=T1>Topic A:</span> topic type A is a subject related to the antecedent part. </li>
    <li> <span class=T2>Topic C:</span> topic type C is a subject related to the consequent part. </li>
    <li> <span class=T3>Topic A+C:</span> topic type A+C is a subject related to both, the antecedent and the consequent part. </li>
    <li> <span class=EL>Left Equivalent:</span> left equivalent is the left part of a sentence with two equivalent statements. </li>
    <li> <span class=ER>Right Equivalent:</span> right equivalent is the right part of a sentence with two equivalent statements. </li>
    <li> <span class=H>Headlines:</span> are already preclassified and function as a guideline for the user. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3> Example 3 </h3>
<p>
<span class=EL>The term ``foreign nonbank financial company''</span> <span class=ER>means a company</span> <span class=A1>(other than a company that is, <span class=A2>or is treated in the United States as,</span> a bank holding company)</span> <span class=A1>that is (i) incorporated or organized in a country other than the United States;</span> <span class=A1> and (ii) predominantly engaged in, <span class=A2>including through a branch in the United States,</span> financial activities,</span> <span class=A1>as defined in paragraph (6).</span>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<h3> Classification:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select a part of a sentence.</li>
<li>Click on the appropriate classification on the right-hand side.</li>
<li>The part is colored accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Layers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always first classify the first layer before classifying the second layer.</li>
<li>Highlight the part of L1 that is to be classified as L2.</li>
<li>Click on the appropriate classification on the right-hand side.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Corrections:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To delete the classification, right-click on the corresponding part of the sentene in the text.</li>
<li>Now, you may classify it again.</li>
<li><b>Attention!</b> When deleting a layered part, right-click on the L2 part.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Save:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <span style="background-color: #ff0000">SAVE !</span> button on the bottom right.</li>
<li><b>Careful!</b> Once you have saved your results, you cannot make corrections anymore.</li>
<li> You have to manually save your results before switching titles or logging out. Otherwise your classifications will be deleted. Recommended is saving after a sentence has been classified successfully.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Further instructions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always include parenthesis into the part of sentence.</li>
