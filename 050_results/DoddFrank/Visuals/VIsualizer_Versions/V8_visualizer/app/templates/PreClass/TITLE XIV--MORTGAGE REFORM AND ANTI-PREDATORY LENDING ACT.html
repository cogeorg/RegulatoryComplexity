<span class="EconomicOperands">  IMPORTANCE  </span> OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND <span class="EconomicOperands">  REGULATION OF  </span> THE TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE CREDIT.  <div class="ex5">   (a) Findings.-- The Congress finds as follows:   <div class="ex6"> (1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home <span class="EconomicOperands">  Loan  </span> Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to ensure a reliable and <span class="EconomicOperands">  affordable  </span> supply of mortgage <span class="EconomicOperands">  funding,  </span> but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations with Government mandated <span class="EconomicOperands">  affordable  </span> housing <span class="EconomicOperands">  goals.  </span> </div>   <div class="ex6"> (2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels below the median for a given area. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development revised those <span class="EconomicOperands">  goals,  </span> increasing them to 56 percent of their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be ``special <span class="EconomicOperands">  affordable''  </span> <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> made to borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an area's median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (4) To help fulfill those mandated <span class="EconomicOperands">  affordable  </span> housing <span class="EconomicOperands">  goals,  </span> in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> securities that included <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> made to low-income borrowers. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (5) After this authorization to purchase <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> securities, <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> and near-prime <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> increased from 9 percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding increase in <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> and Alt-A <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> from 10.1 percent to 32.7 percent over the same period. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased $175,000,000,000 in <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> mortgage securities, which accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in <span class="EconomicOperands">  subprime  </span> and Alt-A <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans,  </span> while Fannie Mae's acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down <span class="EconomicOperands">  payments  </span> almost tripled. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage <span class="EconomicOperands">  debt  </span> in the <span class="EconomicOperands">  United States  </span> and have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the residential <span class="EconomicOperands">  debt  </span> market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage <span class="EconomicOperands">  debt  </span> in the <span class="EconomicOperands">  United States.  </span> </div>   <div class="ex6"> (8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each enterprise's common stock. </div>   <div class="ex6"> (9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 worth of <span class="EconomicOperands">  risk.  </span> </div>   <div class="ex6"> (10) The <span class="EconomicOperands">  hybrid  </span> public-private status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the <span class="EconomicOperands">  loans  </span> and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive. </div>  </div>  <div class="ex5"> (b) Sense of the Congress.-- It is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and <span class="EconomicOperands">  regulation of  </span> the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural <span class="EconomicOperands">  reforms  </span> of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
