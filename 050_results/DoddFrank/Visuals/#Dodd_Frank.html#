            (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            <div class="ex6">(1) The proper functioning of the financial markets is dependent upon safe and efficient arrangements for the clearing and settlement of payment, securities, and other financial transactions.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(2) Financial market utilities that conduct or support multilateral payment, clearing, or settlement activities may reduce risks for their participants and the broader financial system, but such utilities may also concentrate and create new risks and thus must be well designed and operated in a safe and sound manner.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(3) Payment, clearing, and settlement activities conducted by financial institutions also present important risks to the participating financial institutions and to the financial system.</div>
            <div class="ex6">
               (4) Enhancements to the regulation and supervision of systemically important financial market utilities and the conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions are necessary--
               <div class="ex7">(A) to provide consistency;</div>
               <div class="ex7">(B) to promote robust risk management and safety and soundness;</div>

               <div class="ex7">(B) conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions;</div>
            </div>
            <div class="ex6">(2) providing the Board of Governors an enhanced role in the supervision of risk management standards for systemically important financial market utilities;</div>
            <div class="ex6">(3) strengthening the liquidity of systemically important financial market utilities; and</div>

         Subtitle C--Improvements to the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies
         <div class="ex4" Notes_1="15 USC 78o-7 note.">
            SEC. 931. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following:
            <div class="ex6">(1) Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings and the reliance placed on credit ratings by individual and institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities and performances of credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, are matters of national public interest, as credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(2) Credit rating agencies, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, play a critical ``gatekeeper'' role in the debt market that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the quality of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial statements of firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public oversight and accountability.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(3) Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of clients, much as other financial ``gatekeepers'' do, the activities of credit rating agencies are fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(4) In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers of structured financial products on potential ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of interest that need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be addressed explicitly in legislation in order to give clearer authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</div>
            <div class="ex6">(5) In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured financial products have proven to be inaccurate. This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the economy in the United States and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates increased accountability on the part of credit rating agencies.</div>

            SEC. 1491. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND REGULATION OF THE TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE CREDIT.
            <div class="ex5">
               (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
               <div class="ex6">(1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations with Government mandated affordable housing goals.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels below the median for a given area.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be ``special affordable'' loans made to borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an area's median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals, in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(5) After this authorization to purchase subprime securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 percent to 32.7 percent over the same period.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie Mae's acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down payments almost tripled.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each enterprise's common stock.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 worth of risk.</div>
               <div class="ex6">(10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="ex5">(b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</div>
