<div class = "ex6">"(1) In general.

A creditor shall determine the ability of the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">"(4) Income verification. A creditor making a residential mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumers Internal Revenue Service Form W2, tax returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumers income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in making a determination under this subsection shall include the verification of such income by the use of 
<div class = "ex7">"(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax returns; or 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies income documentation by a third party subject to rules prescribed by the Board.

</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is lower than the interest rate of the original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that the department or agency shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, or issue. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(E) The refinancing is subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the refinancing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in a balloon payment, as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)(ii).

For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumers ability to repay a variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any principal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully amortizing repayment schedule. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(B) Interest-only loans. For purposes of determining, under this subsection, a consumers ability to repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or requires the payment of interest only, the creditor shall use the payment amount required to amortize the loan by its final maturity.

<div class = "ex7">"(C) Calculation for negative amortization. In making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall also take into consideration any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization provision. 
</div>
<div class = "ex7">"(D) Calculation process. For purposes of making any determination under this subsection, a creditor shall calculate the monthly payment amount for principal and interest on any residential mortgage loan by assuming 
<div class = "ex8">"(i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on the date of the consummation of the loan; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">"(ii) the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal monthly amortizing payments for principal and interest over the entire term of the loan with no balloon payment, unless the loan contract requires more rapid repayment (including balloon payment), in which case the calculation shall be made (I) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board, with respect to any loan which has an annual percentage rate that does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is set, by 1.5 or more percentage points for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and by 3.5 or more percentage points for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; or (II) using the contracts repayment schedule, with respect to a loan which has an annual percentage rate, as of the date the interest rate is set, that is at least 1.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a first lien residential mortgage loan; and 3.5 percentage points above the average prime offer rate for a subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; and

In considering any application for refinancing an existing hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard loan to be made by the same creditor in any case in which there would be a reduction in monthly payment and the mortgagor has not been delinquent on any payment on the existing hybrid loan, the creditor may 
<div class = "ex8">"(i) consider the mortgagors good standing on the existing mortgage; 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">"(ii) consider if the extension of new credit would prevent a likely default should the original mortgage reset and give such concerns a higher priority as an acceptable underwriting practice; and 
</div>
<div class = "ex8">"(iii) offer rate discounts and other favorable terms to such mortgagor that would be available to new customers with high credit ratings based on such underwriting practice. 
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex6">"(7) Fully-indexed rate defined. For purposes of this subsection, the term "fully indexed rate" means the index rate prevailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan is made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration of any introductory interest rates.

<div class = "ex2">SUBTITLE H Miscellaneous provisions. 
<div class = "ex4">SEC. 1491. Sense of Congress regarding the importance of government-sponsored enterprises reform to enhance the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit. 
<div class = "ex5">(a) Findings. The Congress finds as follows: 
<div class = "ex6">(1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations with Government mandated affordable housing goals. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development required that 42 percent of Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels below the median for a given area. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac be "special affordable" loans made to borrowers with incomes less than 60 percent of an areas median income, a target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals, in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(5) After this authorization to purchase subprime securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 percent to 32.7 percent over the same period. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie Maes acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down payments almost tripled. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each enterprises common stock. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 worth of risk. 
</div>
<div class = "ex6">(10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or abusive. 
</div>
</div>
<div class = "ex5">(b) Sense of the Congress. It is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
</div>
