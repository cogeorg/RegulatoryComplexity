           In the <i>Regulation</i> column on the left hand side of the screen you find a list of regulations applicable to the Balance Sheet on the right hand side of the screen. Evaluate how much <b> regulatory capital</b> the hypothetical bank, based in France (which is in the European Union), is required to have to stay solvent according to the rules given in the Regulation column. Enter your answer (in EUR) as fast as possible in the <b>Enter answer</b> field and click "Save and continue".<br>
           <br>
           In the <i>Balance Sheet</i> column on the right of the screen you see the asset side of a hypothetical bank. Each row is an entry on the balance sheet and the <b>Type</b> denotes what kind of entry it is. <b>Amount</b> is the amount, <b>Denomination</b> is the currency in which the amount is denominated (including whether it is in national or foreign currency), <b>Maturity</b> denotes the remaining maturity of the asset in years, <b>Counterparty of issuer</b> indicates who issued the asset, and the <b>Guarantor</b> indicates if another party guarantees the asset.<br>
           <br>
           There is a timer on the left to show how much time elapsed since you started the evaluation of this regulation. You can access a template that you can use to calculate the required capital by clicking the blue "Download Excel Template" button on the top left.
