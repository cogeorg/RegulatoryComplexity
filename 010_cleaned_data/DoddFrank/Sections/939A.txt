                          RELIANCE ON RATINGS.

    (a) Agency Review.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; Not later than 1 year after 
the date of the enactment of this subtitle, each Federal agency shall, 
to the extent applicable, review--
            (1) any regulation issued by such agency that requires the 
        use of an assessment of the credit-worthiness of a security or 
        money market instrument; and
            (2) any references to or requirements in such regulations 
        regarding credit ratings.

    (b) Modifications Required.--Each such agency shall modify any such 
regulations identified by the review conducted under subsection (a) to 
remove any reference to or requirement of reliance on credit ratings and 
to substitute in such regulations such standard of credit-worthiness as 
each respective agency shall determine as appropriate for such 
regulations. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Standards.&gt;&gt; In making such determination, such 
agencies shall seek to establish, to the extent feasible, uniform 
standards of credit-worthiness for use by each such agency, taking into 
account the entities regulated by each such agency and the purposes for 
which such entities would rely on such standards of credit-worthiness.

    (c) Report.--Upon conclusion of the review required under subsection 
(a), each Federal agency shall transmit a report to Congress containing 
a description of any modification of any regulation such agency made 
pursuant to subsection (b).
