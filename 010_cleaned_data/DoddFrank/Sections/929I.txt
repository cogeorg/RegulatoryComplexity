            (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``$100,000 for each 
        such customer'' and inserting ``the standard maximum cash 
        advance amount for each such customer, as determined in 
        accordance with subsection (d)''; and
            (2) by adding the following new subsections:

    ``(d) Standard Maximum Cash Advance Amount Defined.--For purposes of 
this section, the term `standard maximum cash advance amount' means 
$250,000, as such amount may be adjusted after December 31, 2010, as 
provided under subsection (e).
    ``(e) Inflation Adjustment.--
            ``(1) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadlines. Determination.&gt;&gt;  In general.--Not 
        later than January 1, 2011, and every 5 years thereafter, and 
        subject to the approval of the Commission as provided under 
        section 3(e)(2), the Board of Directors of SIPC shall determine 
        whether an inflation adjustment to the standard maximum cash 
        advance amount is appropriate. If the Board of Directors of SIPC 
        determines such an adjustment is appropriate, then the standard 
        maximum cash advance amount shall be an amount equal to--
                    ``(A) $250,000 multiplied by--
                    ``(B) the ratio of the annual value of the Personal 
                Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index (or any 
                successor index thereto), published by the Department of 
                Commerce, for the calendar year preceding the year in 
                which such determination is made, to the published 
                annual value of such index for the calendar year 
                preceding the year in which this subsection was enacted.
        The index values used in calculations under this paragraph shall 
        be, as of the date of the calculation, the values most recently 
        published by the Department of Commerce.
            ``(2) Rounding.--If the standard maximum cash advance amount 
        determined under paragraph (1) for any period is not


        a multiple of $10,000, the amount so determined shall be rounded 
        down to the nearest $10,000.
            ``(3) Publication and report to the congress.--Not later 
        than April 5 of any calendar year in which a determination is 
        required to be made under paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Federal Register, publication.&gt;&gt;  the 
                Commission shall publish in the Federal Register the 
                standard maximum cash advance amount; and
                    ``(B) the Board of Directors of SIPC shall submit a 
                report to the Congress stating the standard maximum cash 
                advance amount.
            ``(4) Implementation period.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Effective date.&gt;&gt; Any 
        adjustment to the standard maximum cash advance amount shall 
        take effect on January 1 of the year immediately succeeding the 
        calendar year in which such adjustment is made.
            ``(5) Inflation adjustment considerations.--In making any 
        determination under paragraph (1) to increase the standard 
        maximum cash advance amount, the Board of Directors of SIPC 
        shall consider--
                    ``(A) the overall state of the fund and the economic 
                conditions affecting members of SIPC;
                    ``(B) the potential problems affecting members of 
                SIPC; and
                    ``(C) such other factors as the Board of Directors 
                of SIPC may determine appropriate.''.

    (b) Liquidation of a Carrying Broker-dealer.--Section 5(a)(3) of the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78eee(a)(3)) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking the undesignated matter immediately 
        following subparagraph (B);
            (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``any member of SIPC'' 
        and inserting ``the member'';
            (3) in subparagraph (B), by striking the comma at the end 
        and inserting a period;
            (4) by striking ``If SIPC'' and inserting the following:
                    ``(A) In general.--SIPC may, upon notice to a member 
                of SIPC, file an application for a protective decree 
                with any court of competent jurisdiction specified in 
                section 21(e) or 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
                1934, except that no such application shall be filed 
                with respect to a member, the only customers of which 
                are persons whose claims could not be satisfied by SIPC 
                advances pursuant to section 9, if SIPC''; and

                a customer may enter into an insolvency, receivership, 
                or bankruptcy proceeding, under Federal or State law, 
                without the specific consent of SIPC, except as provided
