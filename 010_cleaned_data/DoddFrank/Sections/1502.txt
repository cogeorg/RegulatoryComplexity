    (a) Sense of Congress on Exploitation and Trade of Conflict Minerals 
Originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals 
originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is helping to 
finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the 
eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly sexual- and 
gender-based violence, and contributing to an emergency humanitarian 
situation therein, warranting the provisions of section 13(p) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by subsection (b).
    (b) Disclosure Relating to Conflict Minerals Originating in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo.--Section 13 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m), as amended by this Act, is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:

                the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining 
                country and, in cases in which such conflict minerals 
                did originate in any such country, submit to the 
                Commission a report that includes, with respect to the
