If after the additional 180-day period the Director of         the Division of Enforcement of the Commission or the Director's         designee determines that a particular enforcement investigation         is sufficiently complex such that a determination regarding the         filing of an action against a person cannot be completed within         the additional 180-day period, the Director of the Division of         Enforcement of the Commission or the Director's designee may,         after providing notice to and receiving approval of the         Commission, extend such deadline as needed for one or more         additional successive 180-day periods.    ``(b) Compliance Examinations and Inspections.--            ``(1) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Notification.&gt;&gt;  In general.--Not later than         180 days after the date on which Commission staff completes the         on-site portion of its compliance examination or inspection or         receives all records requested from the entity being examined or         inspected, whichever is later, Commission staff shall provide         the entity being examined or inspected with written notification         indicating either that the examination or inspection has         concluded, has concluded without findings, or that the staff         requests the entity undertake corrective action.            ``(2) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Time period.&gt;&gt;  Exception for certain complex         actions.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the head of any         division or office within the Commission responsible for         compliance examinations and inspections or his designee         determines that a particular compliance examination or         inspection is sufficiently complex such that a determination         regarding concluding the examination or inspection, or regarding         the staff requests the entity undertake corrective action,         cannot be completed within the deadline specified in paragraph         (1), the head of any division or office within the Commission         responsible for compliance examinations and inspections or his         designee may, after providing notice to the Chairman of the         Commission, extend such deadline as needed for one additional         180-day period.''.
