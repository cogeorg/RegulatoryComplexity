    (a) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Public comment.&gt;&gt;  In General.--The Securities and 
Exchange Commission of the United States shall solicit public comment 
and thereafter conduct a study to determine the extent to which private 
rights of action under the antifraud provisions of the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-4) should be extended to cover--
            (1) conduct within the United States that constitutes a 
        significant step in the furtherance of the violation, even if 
        the securities transaction occurs outside the United States and 
        involves only foreign investors; and
            (2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a 
        foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.

    (b) Contents.--The study shall consider and analyze, among other 
things--
            (1) the scope of such a private right of action, including 
        whether it should extend to all private actors or whether it 
        should be more limited to extend just to institutional investors 
        or otherwise;
            (2) what implications such a private right of action would 
        have on international comity;
            (3) the economic costs and benefits of extending a private 
        right of action for transnational securities frauds; and
            (4) whether a narrower extraterritorial standard should be 
        adopted.

    (c) Report.--A report of the study shall be submitted and 
recommendations made to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
House not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act.
