    (a) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Public comment.&gt;&gt;  In General.--The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States shall solicit public comment and thereafter conduct a study to determine the extent to which private rights of action under the antifraud provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78u-4) should be extended to cover--            (1) conduct within the United States that constitutes a         significant step in the furtherance of the violation, even if         the securities transaction occurs outside the United States and         involves only foreign investors; and            (2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a         foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.    (b) Contents.--The study shall consider and analyze, among other things--            (1) the scope of such a private right of action, including         whether it should extend to all private actors or whether it         should be more limited to extend just to institutional investors         or otherwise;            (2) what implications such a private right of action would         have on international comity;            (3) the economic costs and benefits of extending a private         right of action for transnational securities frauds; and            (4) whether a narrower extraterritorial standard should be         adopted.    (c) Report.--A report of the study shall be submitted and recommendations made to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act.
