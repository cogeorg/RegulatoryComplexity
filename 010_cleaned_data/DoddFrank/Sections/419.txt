    Section 205(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80b-5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``With 
respect &lt;&lt;NOTE: Order. Deadlines.&gt;&gt;  to any factor used in any rule or 
regulation by the Commission in making a determination under this 
subsection, if the Commission uses a dollar amount test in connection 
with such factor, such as a net asset threshold, the Commission shall, 
by order, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the 
Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010, and every 5 
years thereafter, adjust for the effects of inflation on such test. Any 
such adjustment that is not a multiple of $100,000 shall be rounded to 
the nearest multiple of $100,000.''.
