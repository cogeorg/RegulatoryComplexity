        be used to comply with Tier 1 capital requirements;
            (4) the economic impact of prohibiting the use of such 
        capital instruments for Tier 1;

        preferred instruments, and whether it could lead to the failure 
        or undercapitalization of existing banking organizations;
            (6) the international competitive implications prohibiting 
        hybrid capital instruments for Tier 1;
            (7) the impact on the cost and availability of credit in the

        United States;
            (3) the extent to which foreign banks are subject on a 
        consolidated basis to home country capital standards comparable 
        to United States capital standards;

        soundness of our financial system and potential economic impact 
        of such a prohibition.
