            (1) Rule &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 1639c note.&gt;&gt;  of construction.--No 
        regulation, order, or guidance issued by the Bureau under this 
        title shall be construed as requiring a depository institution 
        to apply mortgage underwriting standards that do not meet the 
        minimum underwriting standards required by the appropriate 
        prudential regulator of the depository institution.
            (2) Amendment to truth in lending act.--Chapter 2 of the

        following new section:
``Sec. 129C. Minimum &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 1639c.&gt;&gt;  standards for 
                  residential mortgage loans

    ``(a) Ability To Repay.--
            ``(1) In general.--In accordance with regulations prescribed 
        by the Board, no creditor may make a residential mortgage loan 
        unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith 
        determination based on verified and documented information that, 
        at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a 
        reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, 
        and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage 
        guarantee insurance), and assessments.
            ``(2) Multiple loans.--If the creditor knows, or has reason 
        to know, that 1 or more residential mortgage loans secured


        by the same dwelling will be made to the same consumer, the 
        creditor shall make a reasonable and good faith determination, 
        based on verified and documented information, that the consumer 
        has a reasonable ability to repay the combined payments of all 
        loans on the same dwelling according to the terms of those loans 
        and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage 
        guarantee insurance), and assessments.
            ``(3) Basis for determination.--A determination under this 
        subsection of a consumer's ability to repay a residential 
        mortgage loan shall include consideration of the consumer's 
        credit history, current income, expected income the consumer is 
        reasonably assured of receiving, current obligations, debt-to-
        income ratio or the residual income the consumer will have after 
        paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related obligations, 
        employment status, and other financial resources other than the 
        consumer's equity in the dwelling or real property that secures 
        repayment of the loan. A creditor shall determine the ability of 
        the consumer to repay using a payment schedule that fully 
        amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.
            ``(4) Income verification.--A creditor making a residential 
        mortgage loan shall verify amounts of income or assets that such 
        creditor relies on to determine repayment ability, including 
        expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer's Internal 
        Revenue Service Form W-2, tax returns, payroll receipts, 
        financial institution records, or other third-party documents 
        that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer's 
        income or assets. In order to safeguard against fraudulent 
        reporting, any consideration of a consumer's income history in 
        making a determination under this subsection shall include the 
        verification of such income by the use of--
                    ``(A) Internal Revenue Service transcripts of tax 
                returns; or
                    ``(B) a method that quickly and effectively verifies 
                income documentation by a third party subject to rules 
                prescribed by the Board.
            ``(5) Exemption.--With respect to loans made, guaranteed, or 
        insured by Federal departments or agencies identified in 
        subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii), such departments or agencies may 
        exempt refinancings under a streamlined refinancing from this 
        income verification requirement as long as the following 
        conditions are met:
                    ``(A) The consumer is not 30 days or more past due 
                on the prior existing residential mortgage loan.
                    ``(B) The refinancing does not increase the 
                principal balance outstanding on the prior existing 
                residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees 
                and charges allowed by the department or agency making, 
                guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.
                    ``(C) Total points and fees (as defined in section 
                103(aa)(4), other than bona fide third party charges not 
                retained by the mortgage originator, creditor, or an 
                affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator) 
                payable in connection with the refinancing do not exceed 
                3 percent of the total new loan amount.
                    ``(D) The interest rate on the refinanced loan is 
                lower than the interest rate of the original loan, 
                unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable 
                rate to a fixed-


                rate loan, under guidelines that the department or 
                agency shall establish for loans they make, guarantee, 
                or issue.
                    ``(E) The &lt;&lt;NOTE: Regulations.&gt;&gt; refinancing is 
                subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize 
                the refinancing in accordance with the regulations 
                prescribed by the department or agency making, 
                guaranteeing, or insuring the refinancing.
                    ``(F) The terms of the refinancing do not result in 
                a balloon payment, as defined in subsection 
                (b)(2)(A)(ii).
                    ``(G) Both the residential mortgage loan being 
                refinanced and the refinancing satisfy all requirements 
                of the department or agency making, guaranteeing, or 
                insuring the refinancing.
            ``(6) Nonstandard loans.--
                    ``(A) Variable rate loans that defer repayment of 
                any principal or interest.--For purposes of determining, 
                under this subsection, a consumer's ability to repay a 
                variable rate residential mortgage loan that allows or 
                requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any 
                principal or interest, the creditor shall use a fully 
                amortizing repayment schedule.
                    ``(B) Interest-only loans.--For purposes of 
                determining, under this subsection, a consumer's ability 
                to repay a residential mortgage loan that permits or 
                requires the payment of interest only, the creditor 
                shall use the payment amount required to amortize the 
                loan by its final maturity.
                    ``(C) Calculation for negative amortization.--In 
                making any determination under this subsection, a 
                creditor shall also take into consideration any balance 
                increase that may accrue from any negative amortization 
                provision.
                    ``(D) Calculation process.--For purposes of making 
                any determination under this subsection, a creditor 
                shall calculate the monthly payment amount for principal 
                and interest on any residential mortgage loan by 
                assuming--
                          ``(i) the loan proceeds are fully disbursed on 
                      the date of the consummation of the loan;
                          ``(ii) the loan is to be repaid in 
                      substantially equal monthly amortizing payments 
                      for principal and interest over the entire term of 
                      the loan with no balloon payment, unless the loan 
                      contract requires more rapid repayment (including 
                      balloon payment), in which case the calculation 
                      shall be made (I) in accordance with regulations 
                      prescribed by the Board, with respect to any loan 
                      which has an annual percentage rate that does not 
                      exceed the average prime offer rate for a 
                      comparable transaction, as of the date the 
                      interest rate is set, by 1.5 or more percentage 
                      points for a first lien residential mortgage loan; 
                      and by 3.5 or more percentage points for a 
                      subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; or 
                      (II) using the contract's repayment schedule, with 
                      respect to a loan which has an annual percentage 
                      rate, as of the date the interest rate is set, 
                      that is at least 1.5 percentage points above the 
                      average prime offer rate for a first lien 
                      residential mortgage loan; and 3.5 percentage 
                      points above the average prime offer rate for a 
                      subordinate lien residential mortgage loan; and


                          ``(iii) the interest rate over the entire term 
                      of the loan is a fixed rate equal to the fully 
                      indexed rate at the time of the loan closing, 
                      without considering the introductory rate.
                    ``(E) Refinance of hybrid loans with current 
                lender.--In considering any application for refinancing 
                an existing hybrid loan by the creditor into a standard 
                loan to be made by the same creditor in any case in 
                which there would be a reduction in monthly payment and 
                the mortgagor has not been delinquent on any payment on 
                the existing hybrid loan, the creditor may--
                          ``(i) consider the mortgagor's good standing 
                      on the existing mortgage;
                          ``(ii) consider if the extension of new credit 
                      would prevent a likely default should the original 
                      mortgage reset and give such concerns a higher 
                      priority as an acceptable underwriting practice; 
                      and
                          ``(iii) offer rate discounts and other

                      available to new customers with high credit 
                      ratings based on such underwriting practice.
            ``(7) Fully-indexed rate defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `fully indexed rate' means the index rate 
        prevailing on a residential mortgage loan at the time the loan 
        is made plus the margin that will apply after the expiration of 
        any introductory interest rates.
            ``(8) Reverse mortgages and bridge loans.--This subsection 
        shall not apply with respect to any reverse mortgage or 
        temporary or bridge loan with a term of 12 months or less, 
        including to any loan to purchase a new dwelling where the 
        consumer plans to sell a different dwelling within 12 months.
            ``(9) Seasonal income.--If documented income, including 
        income from a small business, is a repayment source for a 
        residential mortgage loan, a creditor may consider the 
        seasonality and irregularity of such income in the underwriting 
        of and scheduling of payments for such credit.''.

Truth in Lending Act is amended by inserting after the item relating to
