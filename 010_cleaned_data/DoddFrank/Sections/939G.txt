                          ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS.    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``structured finance product'' means an asset-backed security, as defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by section 941, and any structured product based on an asset-backed security, as determined by the Commission, by rule.    (b) Study.--The Commission shall carry out a study of--            (1) the credit rating process for structured finance         products and the conflicts of interest associated with the         issuer-pay and the subscriber-pay models;            (2) the feasibility of establishing a system in which a         public or private utility or a self-regulatory organization         assigns nationally recognized statistical rating organizations         to determine the credit ratings of structured finance products,         including--                    (A) an assessment of potential mechanisms for                 determining fees for the nationally recognized                 statistical rating organizations;                    (B) appropriate methods for paying fees to the                 nationally recognized statistical rating organizations;                    (C) the extent to which the creation of such a                 system would be viewed as the creation of moral hazard                 by the Federal Government; and                    (D) any constitutional or other issues concerning                 the establishment of such a system;            (3) the range of metrics that could be used to determine the         accuracy of credit ratings; and            (4) alternative means for compensating nationally recognized         statistical rating organizations that would create incentives         for accurate credit ratings.    (c) Report and Recommendation.--Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report that contains--            (1) the findings of the study required under subsection (b);         and            (2) any recommendations for regulatory or statutory changes         that the Commission determines should be made to implement the         findings of the study required under subsection (b).    (d) Rulemaking.--            (1) Rulemaking.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Determinations.&gt;&gt; After submission         of the report under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by         rule, as the Commission determines is necessary or appropriate         in the public interest or for the protection of investors,         establish a system[[Page 124 STAT. 1890]]        for the assignment of nationally recognized statistical rating         organizations to determine the initial credit ratings of         structured finance products, in a manner that prevents the         issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured finance         product from selecting the nationally recognized statistical         rating organization that will determine the initial credit         ratings and monitor such credit ratings. In issuing any rule         under this paragraph, the Commission shall give thorough         consideration to the provisions of section 15E(w) of the         Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as that provision would have         been added by section 939D of H.R. 4173 (111th Congress), as         passed by the Senate on May 20, 2010, and shall implement the         system described in such section 939D unless the Commission         determines that an alternative system would better serve the         public interest and the protection of investors.            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may be         construed to limit or suspend any other rulemaking authority of         the Commission.
