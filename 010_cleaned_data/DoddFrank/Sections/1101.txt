    (a) Federal Reserve Act.--The third undesignated paragraph of 
section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 343) (relating to 
emergency lending authority) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(3)(A)'' before ``In unusual'';
            (2) by striking ``individual, partnership, or corporation'' 
        the first place that term appears and inserting the following: 
        ``participant in any program or facility with broad-based 
        eligibility'';
            (3) by striking ``exchange for an individual or a 
        partnership or corporation'' and inserting ``exchange,'';
            (4) by striking ``such individual, partnership, or 
        corporation'' and inserting the following: ``such participant in

            (5) by striking ``for individuals, partnerships,

        program or facility with broad-based eligibility''; and
            (6) by striking ``may prescribe.'' and inserting the

                    ``(B)(i) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Regulation. Procedures.&gt;&gt; As soon 
                as is practicable after the date of enactment of this 
                subparagraph, the Board shall establish, by regulation, 
                in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the 
                policies and procedures governing emergency lending 
                under this paragraph. Such policies and procedures shall 
                be designed to ensure that any emergency lending program 
                or facility is for the purpose of providing liquidity to 
                the financial system, and not to aid a failing financial


                company, and that the security for emergency loans is 
                sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses and that any 
                such program is terminated in a timely and orderly 
                fashion. The policies and procedures established by the 
                Board shall require that a Federal reserve bank assign, 
                consistent with sound risk management practices and to 
                ensure protection for the taxpayer, a lendable value to 
                all collateral for a loan executed by a Federal reserve 
                bank under this paragraph in determining whether the 
                loan is secured satisfactorily for purposes of this 
                paragraph.
                    ``(ii) The Board shall establish procedures to 
                prohibit borrowing from programs and facilities by 
                borrowers that are insolvent. Such procedures may 
                include a certification from the chief executive officer 
                (or other authorized officer) of the borrower, at the 
                time the borrower initially borrows under the program or 
                facility (with a duty by the borrower to update the 
                certification if the information in the certification 
                materially changes), that the borrower is not insolvent. 
                A borrower shall be considered insolvent for purposes of 
                this subparagraph, if the borrower is in bankruptcy, 
                resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
                Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any other Federal 
                or State insolvency proceeding.

                remove assets from the balance sheet of a single and 
                specific company, or that is established for the purpose 
                of assisting a single and specific company avoid 
                bankruptcy, resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank 
                Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any

                be considered a program or facility with broad-based 
                eligibility.

                facility under this paragraph without the prior approval
