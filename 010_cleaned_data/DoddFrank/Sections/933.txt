    ``(m) Accountability.--
            ``(1) In general.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Applicability.&gt;&gt; The enforcement 
        and penalty provisions of this title shall apply to statements 
        made by a credit rating agency in the same manner and to the 
        same extent as such provisions apply to statements made by a 
        registered public accounting firm or a securities analyst under 
        the securities laws, and such statements shall not be deemed 
        forward-looking statements for the purposes of section 21E.
            ``(2) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall issue such rules as 
        may be necessary to carry out this subsection.''.

    (b) State of Mind.--Section 21D(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act

            (1) by striking ``In any'' and inserting the following:
                    ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), in any''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:


                    ``(B) Exception.--In the case of an action for money 
                damages brought against a credit rating agency or a 
                controlling person under this title, it shall be 
                sufficient, for purposes of pleading any required state 
                of mind in relation to such action, that the complaint 
                state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong 
                inference that the credit rating agency knowingly or 
                recklessly failed--
                          ``(i) to conduct a reasonable investigation of 
                      the rated security with respect to the factual 
                      elements relied upon by its own methodology for 
                      evaluating credit risk; or
                          ``(ii) to obtain reasonable verification of 
                      such factual elements (which verification may be 
                      based on a sampling technique that does not amount 
                      to an audit) from other sources that the credit 
                      rating agency considered to be competent and that 
                      were independent of the issuer and underwriter.''.
