Such policies and procedures shall                 be designed to ensure that any emergency lending program                 or facility is for the purpose of providing liquidity to                 the financial system, and not to aid a failing financial[[Page 124 STAT. 2114]]                company, and that the security for emergency loans is                 sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses and that any                 such program is terminated in a timely and orderly                 fashion. The policies and procedures established by the                 Board shall require that a Federal reserve bank assign,                 consistent with sound risk management practices and to                 ensure protection for the taxpayer, a lendable value to                 all collateral for a loan executed by a Federal reserve                 bank under this paragraph in determining whether the                 loan is secured satisfactorily for purposes of this                 paragraph.                    ``(ii) The Board shall establish procedures to                 prohibit borrowing from programs and facilities by                 borrowers that are insolvent.

A borrower shall be considered insolvent for purposes of                 this subparagraph, if the borrower is in bankruptcy,                 resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street                 Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any other Federal                 or State insolvency proceeding.                    ``(iii) A program or facility that is structured to                 remove assets from the balance sheet of a single and                 specific company, or that is established for the purpose                 of assisting a single and specific company avoid                 bankruptcy, resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank                 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any                 other Federal or State insolvency proceeding, shall not                 be considered a program or facility with broad-based                 eligibility.                    ``(iv) The Board may not establish any program or                 facility under this paragraph without the prior approval                 of the Secretary of the Treasury.                    ``(C) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadlines.
