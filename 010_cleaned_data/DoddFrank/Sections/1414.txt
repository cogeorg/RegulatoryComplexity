    Section 130 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1640) is amended 
by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(k) Defense to Foreclosure.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, when a creditor, assignee, or other holder of a residential


        mortgage loan or anyone acting on behalf of such creditor, 
        assignee, or holder, initiates a judicial or nonjudicial 
        foreclosure of the residential mortgage loan, or any other 
        action to collect the debt in connection with such loan, a 
        consumer may assert a violation by a creditor of paragraph (1) 
        or (2) of section 129B(c), or of section 129C(a), as a matter of 
        defense by recoupment or set off without regard for the time 
        limit on a private action for damages under subsection (e).
            ``(2) Amount of recoupment or setoff.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The amount of recoupment or set-
                off under paragraph (1) shall equal the amount to which 
                the consumer would be entitled under subsection (a) for 
                damages for a valid claim brought in an original action 
                against the creditor, plus the costs to the consumer of 
                the action, including a reasonable attorney's fee.
                    ``(B) Special rule.--Where such judgment is rendered 
                after the expiration of the applicable time limit on a 
                private action for damages under subsection (e), the 
                amount of recoupment or set-off under paragraph (1) 
                derived from damages under subsection (a)(4) shall not 
                exceed the amount to which the consumer would have been 
                entitled under subsection (a)(4) for damages computed up 
                to the day preceding the expiration of the applicable 
                time limit.''.
