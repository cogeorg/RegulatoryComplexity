    (a) Size Distinctions.--Section 7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)) is amended--
            (1) by striking subparagraph (D); and
            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D).

    (b) Assessment &lt;&lt;NOTE: 12 USC 1817 note.&gt;&gt; Base.--The Corporation 
shall amend the regulations issued by the Corporation under section 
7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(2)) to 
define the term ``assessment base'' with respect to an insured 
depository institution for purposes of that section 7(b)(2), as an 
amount equal to--
            (1) the average consolidated total assets of the insured 
        depository institution during the assessment period; minus
            (2) the sum of--
                    (A) the average tangible equity of the insured 
                depository institution during the assessment period; and
                    (B) in the case of an insured depository institution 
                that is a custodial bank (as defined by the Corporation, 
                based on factors including the percentage of total 
                revenues generated by custodial businesses and the level 
                of assets under custody) or a banker's bank (as that 
                term is used in section 5136 of the Revised Statutes (12 
                U.S.C. 24)), an amount that the Corporation determines 
                is necessary to establish assessments consistent with 
                the definition under section 7(b)(1) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1)) for a 
                custodial bank or a banker's bank.
