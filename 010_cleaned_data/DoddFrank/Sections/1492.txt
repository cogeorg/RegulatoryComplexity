                          GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM                           TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION,                           AND REGULATION OF THE TERMS OF                           RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE CREDIT.    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:            (1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National         Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan         Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress         to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding,         but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations         with Government mandated affordable housing goals.            (2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development         required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's         mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels         below the median for a given area.            (3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development         revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their         overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated         that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and         Freddie Mac be ``special affordable'' loans made to borrowers         with incomes less than 60 percent of an area's median income, a         target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008.            (4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals,         in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development         authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime         securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.            (5) After this authorization to purchase subprime         securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9         percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006,         while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from         78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a         corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1         percent to 32.7 percent over the same period.            (6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased         $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which         accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005         through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately         $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie         Mae's acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down         payments almost tripled.            (7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance         Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and         Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated         mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3         percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and         have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the         residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of         outstanding mortgage debt in the United States.            (8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and         Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury[[Page 124 STAT. 2206]]        Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least         $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in         exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each         enterprise's common stock.            (9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has         potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000         worth of risk.            (10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and         Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that         consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on         terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans         and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or         abusive.    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
