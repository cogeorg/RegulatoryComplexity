                        REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Study Required.--The Chairman of the Financial Services 
Oversight Council shall carry out a study on the macroeconomic effects 
of the risk retention requirements under this subtitle, and the 
amendments made by this subtitle, with emphasis placed on potential 
beneficial effects with respect to stabilizing the real estate market. 
Such study shall include--
            (1) an analysis of the effects of risk retention on real 
        estate asset price bubbles, including a retrospective estimate 
        of what fraction of real estate losses may have been averted had 
        such requirements been in force in recent years;
            (2) an analysis of the feasibility of minimizing real estate 
        price bubbles by proactively adjusting the percentage of risk 
        retention that must be borne by creditors and securitizers of 
        real estate debt, as a function of regional or national market 
        conditions;
            (3) a comparable analysis for proactively adjusting mortgage 
        origination requirements;
            (4) an assessment of whether such proactive adjustments 
        should be made by an independent regulator, or in a formulaic 
        and transparent manner;
            (5) an assessment of whether such adjustments should take 
        place independently or in concert with monetary policy; and
            (6) recommendations for implementation and enabling 
        legislation.

    (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning 
on the date of the enactment of this title, the Chairman of the 
Financial Services Oversight Council shall issue a report to the 
Congress containing any findings and determinations made in carrying out 
the study required under subsection (a).
