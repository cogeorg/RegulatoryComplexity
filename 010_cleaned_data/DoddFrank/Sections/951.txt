reported publicly by rule or regulation of the Commission.

    ``(e) Exemption.--The Commission may, by rule or order, exempt an 
issuer or class of issuers from the requirement under subsection (a) or 
(b). In determining whether to make an exemption under this subsection, 
the Commission shall take into account, among other considerations, 
whether the requirements under subsections (a) and (b) 
disproportionately burdens small issuers.''.
