    (a) Government Accountability Office Study.--The Comptroller General 
of the United States shall conduct a study that will--
            (1) review the number of employees who leave the Securities 
        and Exchange Commission to work for financial institutions 
        regulated by such Commission;
            (2) determine how many employees who leave the Securities 
        and Exchange Commission worked on cases that involved financial 
        institutions regulated by such Commission;
            (3) review the length of time employees work for the 
        Securities and Exchange Commission before leaving to be employed 
        by financial institutions regulated by such Commission;
            (4) review existing internal controls and make 
        recommendations on strengthening such controls to ensure that 
        employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission who are 
        later employed by financial institutions did not assist such 
        institutions in violating any rules or regulations of the 
        Commission during the course of their employment with such 
        Commission;
            (5) determine if greater post-employment restrictions are 
        necessary to prevent employees of the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission from being employed by financial institutions after 
        employment with such Commission;
            (6) determine if the volume of employees of the Securities 
        and Exchange Commission who are later employed by financial 
        institutions has led to inefficiencies in enforcement;
            (7) determine if employees of the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission who are later employed by financial institutions 
        assisted such institutions in circumventing Federal rules and 
        regulations while employed by such Commission;
            (8) review any information that may address the volume of 
        employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission who are 
        later employed by financial institutions, and make 
        recommendations to Congress; and
            (9) review other additional issues as may be raised during 
        the course of the study conducted under this subsection.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
of this subtitle, the Comptroller General of the United States shall 
submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
