            (1) a study, taking into account current scholarship, on the 
        state of short selling on national securities exchanges and in 
        the over-the-counter markets, with particular attention to the 
        impact of recent rule changes and the incidence of--
                    (A) the failure to deliver shares sold short; or
                    (B) delivery of shares on the fourth day following 
                the short sale transaction; and
            (2) a study of--
                    (A) the feasibility, benefits, and costs of 
                requiring reporting publicly, in real time short sale 
                positions of publicly listed securities, or, in the 
                alternative, reporting such short positions in real time 
                only to the Commission and the Financial Industry 
                Regulatory Authority; and
                    (B) the feasibility, benefits, and costs of 
                conducting a voluntary pilot program in which public 
                companies will agree to have all trades of their shares 
                marked ``short'', ``market maker short'', ``buy'', 
                ``buy-to-cover'', or ``long'', and reported in real time 
                through the Consolidated Tape.

on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee

        later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (2) on the results of the study required under subsection 
        (a)(2), not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
        this Act.
