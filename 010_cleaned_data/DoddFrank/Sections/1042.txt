    (a) In General.--
            (1) Rule of construction.--This title, other than sections 
        1044 through 1048, may not be construed as annulling, altering, 
        or affecting, or exempting any person subject to the provisions 
        of this title from complying with, the statutes, regulations, 
        orders, or interpretations in effect in any State, except to the 
        extent that any such provision of law is inconsistent with the 
        provisions of this title, and then only to the extent of the 
        inconsistency.
            (2) Greater protection under state law.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation 
        in effect in any State is not inconsistent with the provisions 
        of this title if the protection that such statute, regulation, 
        order, or interpretation affords to consumers is greater than 
        the protection provided under this title. A determination 
        regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or 
        interpretation in effect in any State is inconsistent with the 
        provisions of this title may be made by the Bureau on its own 
        motion or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by 
        any interested person.

    (b) Relation to Other Provisions of Enumerated Consumer Laws That 
Relate to State Law.--No provision of this title, except as provided in 
section 1083, shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding 
the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that 
relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect 
to such Federal law.
    (c) Additional Consumer Protection Regulations in Response to State 
Action.--
            (1) Notice of proposed rule required.--The Bureau shall 
        issue a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever a majority of the 
        States has enacted a resolution in support of the establishment 
        or modification of a consumer protection regulation by the 
        Bureau.
            (2) Bureau considerations required for issuance of final 
        regulation.--Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a 
        notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take 
        into account whether--


                    (A) the proposed regulation would afford greater 
                protection to consumers than any existing regulation;
                    (B) the intended benefits of the proposed regulation 
                for consumers would outweigh any increased costs or 
                inconveniences for consumers, and would not discriminate 
                unfairly against any category or class of consumers; and
                    (C) a Federal banking agency has advised that the 
                proposed regulation is likely to present an unacceptable 
                safety and soundness risk to insured depository 
                institutions.
            (3) Explanation of considerations.--The Bureau--
                    (A) shall include a discussion of the considerations 
                required in paragraph (2) in the Federal Register notice 
                of a final regulation prescribed pursuant to this 
                subsection; and
                    (B) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Federal Register, publication.&gt;&gt;  
                whenever the Bureau determines not to prescribe a final 
                regulation, shall publish an explanation of such 
                determination in the Federal Register, and provide a 
                copy of such explanation to each State that enacted a 
                resolution in support of the proposed regulation, the 
                Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
                Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
                House of Representatives.
            (4) Reservation of authority.--No provision of this 
        subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the 
        authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards 
        established pursuant to this title in response to its own motion 
        or in response to a request by any other interested person.
            (5) Rule of construction.--No provision of this subsection 
        shall be construed as exempting the Bureau from complying with 
        subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code.
            (6) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``consumer protection regulation'' means a regulation that the 
        Bureau is authorized to prescribe under the Federal consumer 
        financial laws.
