    (a) In General.--            (1) Rule of construction.--This title, other than sections         1044 through 1048, may not be construed as annulling, altering,         or affecting, or exempting any person subject to the provisions         of this title from complying with, the statutes, regulations,         orders, or interpretations in effect in any State, except to the         extent that any such provision of law is inconsistent with the         provisions of this title, and then only to the extent of the         inconsistency.            (2) Greater protection under state law.--For purposes of         this subsection, a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation         in effect in any State is not inconsistent with the provisions         of this title if the protection that such statute, regulation,         order, or interpretation affords to consumers is greater than         the protection provided under this title. A determination         regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or         interpretation in effect in any State is inconsistent with the         provisions of this title may be made by the Bureau on its own         motion or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by         any interested person.    (b) Relation to Other Provisions of Enumerated Consumer Laws That Relate to State Law.--No provision of this title, except as provided in section 1083, shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect to such Federal law.    (c) Additional Consumer Protection Regulations in Response to State Action.--            (1) Notice of proposed rule required.--The Bureau shall         issue a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever a majority of the         States has enacted a resolution in support of the establishment         or modification of a consumer protection regulation by the         Bureau.            (2) Bureau considerations required for issuance of final         regulation.--Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a         notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take         into account whether--[[Page 124 STAT. 2012]]                    (A) the proposed regulation would afford greater                 protection to consumers than any existing regulation;                    (B) the intended benefits of the proposed regulation                 for consumers would outweigh any increased costs or                 inconveniences for consumers, and would not discriminate                 unfairly against any category or class of consumers; and                    (C) a Federal banking agency has advised that the                 proposed regulation is likely to present an unacceptable                 safety and soundness risk to insured depository                 institutions.            (3) Explanation of considerations.--The Bureau--                    (A) shall include a discussion of the considerations                 required in paragraph (2) in the Federal Register notice                 of a final regulation prescribed pursuant to this                 subsection; and                    (B) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Federal Register, publication.&gt;&gt;                  whenever the Bureau determines not to prescribe a final                 regulation, shall publish an explanation of such                 determination in the Federal Register, and provide a                 copy of such explanation to each State that enacted a                 resolution in support of the proposed regulation, the                 Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the                 Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the                 House of Representatives.            (4) Reservation of authority.--No provision of this         subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the         authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards         established pursuant to this title in response to its own motion         or in response to a request by any other interested person.            (5) Rule of construction.--No provision of this subsection         shall be construed as exempting the Bureau from complying with         subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code.            (6) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term         ``consumer protection regulation'' means a regulation that the         Bureau is authorized to prescribe under the Federal consumer         financial laws.
