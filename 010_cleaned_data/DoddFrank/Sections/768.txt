    Section 28(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
78bb(a)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) Limitation on Judgments.--


            ``(1) In general.--No person permitted to maintain a suit 
        for damages under the provisions of this title shall recover, 
        through satisfaction of judgment in 1 or more actions, a total 
        amount in excess of the actual damages to that person on account 
        of the act complained of. Except as otherwise specifically 
        provided in this title, nothing in this title shall affect the 
        jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or 
        officer performing like functions) of any State over any 
        security or any person insofar as it does not conflict with the 
        provisions of this title or the rules and regulations under this 
        title.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Except as provided in 
        subsection (f), the rights and remedies provided by this title 
        shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies 
        that may exist at law or in equity.
            ``(3) State bucket shop laws.--No State law which prohibits 
        or regulates the making or promoting of wagering or gaming 
        contracts, or the operation of `bucket shops' or other similar 
        or related activities, shall invalidate--
                    ``(A) any put, call, straddle, option, privilege, or 
                other security subject to this title (except any 
                security that has a pari-mutuel payout or otherwise is 
                determined by the Commission, acting by rule, 
                regulation, or order, to be appropriately subject to 
                such laws), or apply to any activity which is incidental 
                or related to the offer, purchase, sale, exercise, 
                settlement, or closeout of any such security;
                    ``(B) any security-based swap between eligible 
                contract participants; or
                    ``(C) any security-based swap effected on a national 
                securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(b).
            ``(4) Other state provisions.--No provision of State law 
        regarding the offer, sale, or distribution of securities shall 
        apply to any transaction in a security-based swap or a security 
        futures product, except that this paragraph may not be construed 
        as limiting any State antifraud law of general applicability. A 
        security-based swap may not be regulated as an insurance 
        contract under any provision of State law.''.
