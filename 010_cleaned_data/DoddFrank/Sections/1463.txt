            ``(1) In general.--If--
                    ``(A) an impound, trust, or other type of account 
                for the payment of property taxes, insurance premiums,

                connection with the transaction; or
                    ``(B) a consumer chooses, and provides written 
                notice to the creditor or servicer of such choice, at 
                any time after such an account is established in 
                connection with any such transaction and in accordance 
                with any statute, regulation, or contractual agreement, 
                to close such account,
        the creditor or servicer shall provide a timely and clearly 
        written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of 
        the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the 
        consumer in the absence of any such account.
            ``(2) Disclosure requirements.--Any disclosure provided to a 
        consumer under paragraph (1) shall include the following:


                    ``(A) Information concerning any applicable fees or 
                costs associated with either the non-establishment of 
                any such account at the time of the transaction, or any 
                subsequent closure of any such account.
                    ``(B) A clear and prominent statement that the 
                consumer is responsible for personally and directly 
                paying the non-escrowed items, in addition to paying the 
                mortgage loan payment, in the absence of any such 
                account, and the fact that the costs for taxes, 
                insurance, and related fees can be substantial.
                    ``(C) A clear explanation of the consequences of any 
                failure to pay non-escrowed items, including the 
                possible requirement for the forced placement of 
                insurance by the creditor or servicer and the 
                potentially higher cost (including any potential 
                commission payments to the servicer) or reduced coverage 
                for the consumer in the event of any such creditor-
                placed insurance.
                    ``(D) Such other information as the Board determines 
                necessary for the protection of the consumer.''.
