    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after 
section 10C, as added by section 952, the following:
``SEC. 10D. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78j-4.&gt;&gt;  RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY 
                        AWARDED COMPENSATION POLICY.

    ``(a) Listing Standards.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Regulations.&gt;&gt; The Commission 
shall, by rule, direct the national securities exchanges and national 
securities associations to prohibit the listing of any security of an 
issuer that does not comply with the requirements of this section.

    ``(b) Recovery of Funds.--The rules of the Commission under 
subsection (a) shall require each issuer to develop and implement a 
policy providing--
            ``(1) for disclosure of the policy of the issuer on 
        incentive-based compensation that is based on financial 
        information required to be reported under the securities laws; 
        and
            ``(2) that, in the event that the issuer is required to 
        prepare an accounting restatement due to the material 
        noncompliance of the issuer with any financial reporting 
        requirement under the securities laws, the issuer will recover 
        from any current or former executive officer of the issuer who 
        received incentive-based compensation (including stock options 
        awarded as compensation) during the 3-year period preceding the 
        date on which the issuer is required to prepare an accounting 
        restatement, based on the erroneous data, in excess of what 
        would have been paid to the executive officer under the 
        accounting restatement.''.
