                        DISCLOSURE TO INVESTORS.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study and review of the disclosure required to be made by 
issuers of municipal securities.
    (b) Subjects for Evaluation.--In conducting the study under 
subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United States shall--
            (1) broadly describe--
                    (A) the size of the municipal securities markets and 
                the issuers and investors; and
                    (B) the disclosures provided by issuers to 
                investors;
            (2) compare the amount, frequency, and quality of 
        disclosures that issuers of municipal securities are required by 
        law to provide for the benefit of municipal securities holders, 
        including the amount of and frequency of disclosures actually


        provided by issuers of municipal securities, with the amount of 
        and frequency of disclosures that issuers of corporate 
        securities provide for the benefit of corporate securities 
        holders, taking into account the differences between issuers of 
        municipal securities and issuers of corporate securities;
            (3) evaluate the costs and benefits to various types of 
        issuers of municipal securities of requiring issuers of 
        municipal bonds to provide additional financial disclosures for 
        the benefit of investors;
            (4) evaluate the potential benefit to investors from 
        additional financial disclosures by issuers of municipal bonds; 
        and
            (5) make recommendations relating to disclosure requirements 
        for municipal issuers, including the advisability of the repeal 
        or retention of section 15B(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
        1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(d)) (commonly known as the ``Tower 
        Amendment'').

    (c) Report.--Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a 
report to Congress on the results of the study conducted under 
subsection (a), including recommendations for how to improve disclosure 
by issuers of municipal securities.
