    (a) In General.--The Bureau may prescribe rules to ensure that the features of any consumer financial product or service, both initially and over the term of the product or service, are[[Page 124 STAT. 2007]]fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances.    (b) Model Disclosures.--            (1) In general.--Any final rule prescribed by the Bureau         under this section requiring disclosures may include a model         form that may be used at the option of the covered person for         provision of the required disclosures.            (2) Format.--A model form issued pursuant to paragraph (1)         shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclosure that, at a         minimum--                    (A) uses plain language comprehensible to consumers;                    (B) contains a clear format and design, such as an                 easily readable type font; and                    (C) succinctly explains the information that must be                 communicated to the consumer.            (3) Consumer testing.--Any model form issued pursuant to         this subsection shall be validated through consumer testing.

(d) Safe Harbor.--Any covered person that uses a model form included with a rule issued under this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure requirements of this section with respect to such model form.    (e) Trial Disclosure Programs.--            (1) In general.--The Bureau may permit a covered person to         conduct a trial program that is limited in time and scope,         subject to specified standards and procedures, for the purpose         of providing trial disclosures to consumers that are designed to         improve upon any model form issued pursuant to subsection         (b)(1), or any other model form issued to implement an         enumerated statute, as applicable.            (2) Safe harbor.--The standards and procedures issued by the         Bureau shall be designed to encourage covered persons to conduct         trial disclosure programs. For the purposes of administering         this subsection, the Bureau may establish a limited period         during which a covered person conducting a trial disclosure         program shall be deemed to be in compliance with, or may be         exempted from, a requirement of a rule or an enumerated consumer         law.            (3) Public disclosure.--The rules of the Bureau shall         provide for public disclosure of trial disclosure programs,         which public disclosure may be limited, to the extent necessary         to encourage covered persons to conduct effective trials.    (f) Combined Mortgage Loan Disclosure.--Not later &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline. Public comment.&gt;&gt;  than 1 year after the designated transfer date, the Bureau shall propose for public comment rules and model disclosures that combine the disclosures required under the Truth in Lending Act and sections 4 and 5 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, into a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws, unless the Bureau determines that any proposal issued by the Board of Governors and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development carries out the same purpose.[[Page 124 STAT. 2008]]
