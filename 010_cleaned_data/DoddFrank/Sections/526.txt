    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study of the nonadmitted insurance market to determine the 
effect of the enactment of this part on the size and market share of the 
nonadmitted insurance market for providing coverage typically provided 
by the admitted insurance market.
    (b) Contents.--The study shall determine and analyze--
            (1) the change in the size and market share of the 
        nonadmitted insurance market and in the number of insurance 
        companies and insurance holding companies providing such 
        business in the 18-month period that begins upon the effective 
        date of this subtitle;
            (2) the extent to which insurance coverage typically 
        provided by the admitted insurance market has shifted to the 
        nonadmitted insurance market;
            (3) the consequences of any change in the size and market 
        share of the nonadmitted insurance market, including differences 
        in the price and availability of coverage available in both the 
        admitted and nonadmitted insurance markets;
            (4) the extent to which insurance companies and insurance 
        holding companies that provide both admitted and nonadmitted 
        insurance have experienced shifts in the volume of business 
        between admitted and nonadmitted insurance; and
            (5) the extent to which there has been a change in the 
        number of individuals who have nonadmitted insurance policies, 
        the type of coverage provided under such policies, and whether 
        such coverage is available in the admitted insurance market.

    (c) Consultation With NAIC.--In conducting the study under this 
section, the Comptroller General shall consult with the NAIC.
    (d) Report.--The Comptroller General shall complete the study under 
this section and submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing,
