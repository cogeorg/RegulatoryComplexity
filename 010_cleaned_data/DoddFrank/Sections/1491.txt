                          GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES REFORM 
                          TO ENHANCE THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, 
                          AND REGULATION OF THE TERMS OF 
                          RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE CREDIT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Government-sponsored enterprises, Federal National 
        Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan 
        Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), were chartered by Congress 
        to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of mortgage funding, 
        but enjoy a dual legal status as privately owned corporations 
        with Government mandated affordable housing goals.
            (2) In 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        required that 42 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's 
        mortgage financing should go to borrowers with income levels 
        below the median for a given area.
            (3) In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        revised those goals, increasing them to 56 percent of their 
        overall mortgage purchases by 2008, and additionally mandated 
        that 12 percent of all mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac be ``special affordable'' loans made to borrowers 
        with incomes less than 60 percent of an area's median income, a 
        target that ultimately increased to 28 percent for 2008.
            (4) To help fulfill those mandated affordable housing goals, 
        in 1995 the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        authorized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase subprime 
        securities that included loans made to low-income borrowers.
            (5) After this authorization to purchase subprime 
        securities, subprime and near-prime loans increased from 9 
        percent of securitized mortgages in 2001 to 40 percent in 2006, 
        while the market share of conventional mortgages dropped from 
        78.8 percent in 2003 to 50.1 percent by 2007 with a 
        corresponding increase in subprime and Alt-A loans from 10.1 
        percent to 32.7 percent over the same period.
            (6) In 2004 alone, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased 
        $175,000,000,000 in subprime mortgage securities, which 
        accounted for 44 percent of the market that year, and from 2005 
        through 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased approximately 
        $1,000,000,000,000 in subprime and Alt-A loans, while Fannie 
        Mae's acquisitions of mortgages with less than 10 percent down 
        payments almost tripled.
            (7) According to data from the Federal Housing Finance 
        Agency (FHFA) for the fourth quarter of 2008, Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac own or guarantee 75 percent of all newly originated 
        mortgages, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently own 13.3 
        percent of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States and 
        have issued mortgage-backed securities for 31.0 percent of the 
        residential debt market, a combined total of 44.3 percent of 
        outstanding mortgage debt in the United States.
            (8) On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac into conservatorship, with the Treasury


        Department subsequently agreeing to purchase at least 
        $200,000,000,000 of preferred stock from each enterprise in 
        exchange for warrants for the purchase of 79.9 percent of each 
        enterprise's common stock.
            (9) The conservatorship for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has 
        potentially exposed taxpayers to upwards of $5,300,000,000,000 
        worth of risk.
            (10) The hybrid public-private status of Fannie Mae and 
        Freddie Mac is untenable and must be resolved to assure that 
        consumers are offered and receive residential mortgage loans on 
        terms that reasonably reflect their ability to repay the loans 
        and that are understandable and not unfair, deceptive, or 
        abusive.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
efforts to enhance by the protection, limitation, and regulation of the 
terms of residential mortgage credit and the practices related to such 
credit would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural 
reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
