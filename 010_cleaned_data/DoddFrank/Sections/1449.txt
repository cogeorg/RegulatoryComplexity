    ``(i) Accountability for Recipients of Covered Assistance.--
            ``(1) Tracking of funds.--The Secretary shall--
                    ``(A) develop and maintain a system to ensure that 
                any organization or entity that receives any covered 
                assistance uses all amounts of covered assistance in 
                accordance with this section, the regulations issued 
                under this section, and any requirements or conditions 
                under which such amounts were provided; and
                    ``(B) require any organization or entity, as a 
                condition of receipt of any covered assistance, to agree 
                to comply with such requirements regarding covered 
                assistance as the Secretary shall establish, which shall 
                include--
                          ``(i) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Reports. Records.&gt;&gt; appropriate 
                      periodic financial and grant activity reporting, 
                      record retention, and audit requirements for the 
                      duration of the covered assistance to the 
                      organization or entity to ensure compliance with 
                      the limitations and requirements of this section, 
                      the regulations under this section, and any 
                      requirements or conditions under which such 
                      amounts were provided; and
                          ``(ii) any other requirements that the 
                      Secretary determines are necessary to ensure 
                      appropriate administration and compliance.
            ``(2) Misuse of funds.--If any organization or entity that 
        receives any covered assistance is determined by the Secretary 
        to have used any covered assistance in a manner that is 
        materially in violation of this section, the regulations issued 
        under this section, or any requirements or conditions under 
        which such assistance was provided--
                    ``(A) 
                the &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline. Reimbursement.&gt;&gt; Secretary shall 
                require that, within 12 months after the determination 
                of such misuse, the organization or entity shall 
                reimburse the Secretary for such misused amounts and 
                return to the Secretary any such amounts that remain 
                unused or uncommitted for use; and
                    ``(B) such organization or entity shall be 
                ineligible, at any time after such determination, to 
                apply for or receive any further covered assistance.
        The remedies under this paragraph are in addition to any other 
        remedies that may be available under law.
            ``(3) Covered assistance.--For &lt;&lt;NOTE: Definition.&gt;&gt;  
        purposes of this subsection, the term `covered assistance' means 
        any grant or other financial assistance provided under this 
        section.''.
