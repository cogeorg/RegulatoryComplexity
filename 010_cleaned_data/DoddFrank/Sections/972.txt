    (a) Proxy Access.--Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78n(a)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(2) The rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under 
paragraph (1) may include--
            ``(A) a requirement that a solicitation of proxy, consent, 
        or authorization by (or on behalf of) an issuer include a 
        nominee submitted by a shareholder to serve on the board of 
        directors of the issuer; and
            ``(B) a requirement that an issuer follow a certain 
        procedure in relation to a solicitation described in 
        subparagraph (A).''.

    (b) &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78n note.&gt;&gt;  Regulations.--The Commission may 
issue rules permitting the use by a shareholder of proxy solicitation 
materials supplied by an issuer of securities for the purpose of 
nominating individuals to membership on the board of directors of the 
issuer, under such terms and conditions as the Commission determines are 
in the interests of shareholders and for the protection of investors.

    (c) &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78n note.&gt;&gt;  Exemptions.--The Commission may, by 
rule or order, exempt an issuer or class of issuers from the requirement 
made by this section or an amendment made by this section. In 
determining whether to make an exemption under this subsection, the 
Commission shall take into account, among other considerations, whether 
the requirement in the amendment made by subsection (a) 
disproportionately burdens small issuers.
