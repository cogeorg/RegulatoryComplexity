    (a) Study Required.--
            (1) In general.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; Not later than the end 
        of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of 
        this subtitle, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
        (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ``SEC'') shall 
        hire an independent consultant of high caliber and with 
        expertise in organizational restructuring and the operations of 
        capital markets to examine the internal operations, structure, 
        funding, and the need for comprehensive reform of the SEC, as 
        well as the SEC's relationship with and the reliance on self-
        regulatory organizations and other entities relevant to the 
        regulation of securities and the protection of securities 
        investors that are under the SEC's oversight.
            (2) Specific areas for study.--The study required under 
        paragraph (1) shall, at a minimum, include the study of--
                    (A) the possible elimination of unnecessary or 
                redundant units at the SEC;
                    (B) improving communications between SEC offices and 
                divisions;
                    (C) the need to put in place a clear chain-of-
                command structure, particularly for enforcement 
                examinations and compliance inspections;
                    (D) the effect of high-frequency trading and other 
                technological advances on the market and what the SEC 
                requires to monitor the effect of such trading and 
                advances on the market;
                    (E) the SEC's hiring authorities, workplace 
                policies, and personal practices, including--
                          (i) whether there is a need to further 
                      streamline hiring authorities for those who are 
                      not lawyers, accountants, compliance examiners, or 
                      economists;
                          (ii) whether there is a need for further pay 
                      reforms;
                          (iii) the diversity of skill sets of SEC 
                      employees and whether the present skill set 
                      diversity efficiently and effectively fosters the 
                      SEC's mission of investor protection; and
                          (iv) the application of civil service laws by 
                      the SEC;
                    (F) whether the SEC's oversight and reliance on 
                self-regulatory organizations promotes efficient and 
                effective governance for the securities markets; and
                    (G) whether adjusting the SEC's reliance on self-
                regulatory organizations is necessary to promote more 
                efficient and effective governance for the securities 
                markets.

    (b) Consultant Report.--Not later than the end of the 150-day period

        (a)(1); and
            (2) recommendations for legislative, regulatory, or 
        administrative action that the consultant determines appropriate 
        to


        enable the SEC and other entities on which the consultant 
        reports to perform their statutorily or otherwise mandated 
        missions.

    (c) SEC Report.--Not later than the end of the 6-month period 
beginning on the date the consultant issues the report under subsection

a report to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
of the Senate describing the SEC's implementation of the regulatory and 
administrative recommendations contained in the consultant's report.
