    (a) Additional Requirements for Certain Mortgages.--Section 129 of 
the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (j), (k), (l) and (m) as 
        subsections (n), (o), (p), and (q) respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (i) the following new 
        subsections:

    ``(j) Recommended Default.--No creditor shall recommend or encourage 
default on an existing loan or other debt prior to and in connection 
with the closing or planned closing of a high-cost


mortgage that refinances all or any portion of such existing loan or 
debt.
    ``(k) Late Fees.--
            ``(1) In general.--No creditor may impose a late payment 
        charge or fee in connection with a high-cost mortgage--
                    ``(A) in an amount in excess of 4 percent of the 
                amount of the payment past due;
                    ``(B) unless the loan documents specifically 
                authorize the charge or fee;
                    ``(C) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadlines.&gt;&gt; before the end of the 15-
                day period beginning on the date the payment is due, or 
                in the case of a loan on which interest on each 
                installment is paid in advance, before the end of the 
                30-day period beginning on the date the payment is due; 
                or
                    ``(D) more than once with respect to a single late 
                payment.
            ``(2) Coordination with subsequent late fees.--If a payment 
        is otherwise a full payment for the applicable period and is 
        paid on its due date or within an applicable grace period, and 
        the only delinquency or insufficiency of payment is attributable 
        to any late fee or delinquency charge assessed on any earlier 
        payment, no late fee or delinquency charge may be imposed on 
        such payment.
            ``(3) Failure to make installment payment.--If, in the case 
        of a loan agreement the terms of which provide that any payment 
        shall first be applied to any past due principal balance, the 
        consumer fails to make an installment payment and the consumer 
        subsequently resumes making installment payments but has not 
        paid all past due installments, the creditor may impose a 
        separate late payment charge or fee for any principal due 
        (without deduction due to late fees or related fees) until the 
        default is cured.

    ``(l) Acceleration of Debt.--No high-cost mortgage may contain a 
provision which permits the creditor to accelerate the indebtedness, 
except when repayment of the loan has been accelerated by default in 
payment, or pursuant to a due-on-sale provision, or pursuant to a 
material violation of some other provision of the loan document 
unrelated to payment schedule.
    ``(m) Restriction on Financing Points and Fees.--No creditor may 
directly or indirectly finance, in connection with any high-cost 
mortgage, any of the following:
            ``(1) Any prepayment fee or penalty payable by the consumer 
        in a refinancing transaction if the creditor or an affiliate of 
        the creditor is the noteholder of the note being refinanced.
            ``(2) Any points or fees.''.

    (b) Prohibitions on Evasions.--Section 129 of the Truth in Lending

    ``(r) Prohibitions on Evasions, Structuring of Transactions, and 
Reciprocal Arrangements.--A creditor may not take any action in 
connection with a high-cost mortgage--
            ``(1) to structure a loan transaction as an open-end credit 
        plan or another form of loan for the purpose and with the intent 
        of evading the provisions of this title; or


            ``(2) to divide any loan transaction into separate parts for 
        the purpose and with the intent of evading provisions of this 
        title.''.

    (c) Modification or Deferral Fees.--Section 129 of the Truth in 
Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639) is amended by inserting after subsection 
(r) (as added by subsection (b) of this section) the following new 
subsection:
    ``(s) Modification and Deferral Fees Prohibited.--A creditor, 
successor in interest, assignee, or any agent of any of the above, may 
not charge a consumer any fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-
cost mortgage, or to defer any payment due under the terms of such 
mortgage.''.

            ``(1) Fees.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), no creditor or servicer may charge a 
                fee for informing or transmitting to any person the 
                balance due to pay off the outstanding balance on a 
                high-cost mortgage.
                    ``(B) Transaction fee.--When payoff information 
                referred to in subparagraph (A) is provided by facsimile 
                transmission or by a courier service, a creditor or 
                servicer may charge a processing fee to cover the cost 
                of such transmission or service in an amount not to 
                exceed an amount that is comparable to fees imposed for 
                similar services provided in connection with consumer 
                credit transactions that are secured by the consumer's 
                principal dwelling and are not high-cost mortgages.
                    ``(C) Fee disclosure.--Prior to charging a 
                transaction fee as provided in subparagraph (B), a 
                creditor or servicer shall disclose that payoff balances 
                are available for free pursuant to subparagraph (A).
                    ``(D) Multiple requests.--If a creditor or servicer 
                has provided payoff information referred to in 
                subparagraph (A) without charge, other than the 
                transaction fee allowed by subparagraph (B), on 4 
                occasions during a calendar year, the creditor or 
                servicer may thereafter charge a reasonable fee for 
                providing such information during the remainder of the 
                calendar year.
            ``(2) Prompt delivery.--Payoff &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; balances

        not extend credit to a consumer under a high-cost mortgage 
        without first receiving certification from a counselor that is 
        approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or 
        at the discretion of


        the Secretary, a State housing finance authority, that the 
        consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the 
        mortgage. Such counselor shall not be employed by the creditor 
        or an affiliate of the creditor or be affiliated with the 
        creditor.
            ``(2) Disclosures required prior to counseling.--No 
        counselor may certify that a consumer has received counseling on 
        the advisability of the high-cost mortgage unless the counselor 
        can verify that the consumer has received each statement 
        required (in connection with such loan) by this section or the 
        Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 with respect to 
        the transaction.

creditor or assignee in a high-cost mortgage who, when acting in good 
faith, fails to comply with any requirement under this section will not 
be deemed to have violated such requirement if the creditor or assignee 
establishes that either--
            ``(1) within 30 days of the loan closing and prior to the 
        institution of any action, the consumer is notified of or 
        discovers the violation, appropriate restitution is made, and 
        whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to 
        either, at the choice of the consumer--
                    ``(A) make the loan satisfy the requirements of this 
                chapter; or
                    ``(B) in the case of a high-cost mortgage, change 
                the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the
