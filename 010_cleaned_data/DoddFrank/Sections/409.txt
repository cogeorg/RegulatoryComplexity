    (a) In General.--Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act 
of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)) is amended by striking ``or (G)'' and 
inserting the following: ``; (G) any family office, as defined by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, in accordance with the purposes 
of this title; or (H)''.
    (b) Rulemaking.--The &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 80b-2 note.&gt;&gt; rules, 
regulations, or orders issued by the Commission pursuant to section 
202(a)(11)(G) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as added by this 
section, regarding the definition of the term ``family office'' shall 
provide for an exemption that--
            (1) is consistent with the previous exemptive policy of the 
        Commission, as reflected in exemptive orders for family offices 
        in effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and the 
        grandfathering provisions in paragraph (3);
            (2) recognizes the range of organizational, management, and 
        employment structures and arrangements employed by family 
        offices; and
            (3) does not exclude any person who was not registered or 
        required to be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 
        1940 on January 1, 2010 from the definition of the term ``family 
        office'', solely because such person provides investment advice 
        to, and was engaged before January 1, 2010 in providing 
        investment advice to--


                    (A) natural persons who, at the time of their 
                applicable investment, are officers, directors, or 
                employees of the family office who--
                          (i) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; have invested with the 
                      family office before January 1, 2010; and
                          (ii) are accredited investors, as defined in 
                      Regulation D of the Commission (or any successor 
                      thereto) under the Securities Act of 1933, or, as 
                      the Commission may prescribe by rule, the 
                      successors-in-interest thereto;
                    (B) any company owned exclusively and controlled by 
                members of the family of the family office, or as the 
                Commission may prescribe by rule;
                    (C) any investment adviser registered under the 
                Investment Adviser Act of 1940 that provides investment 
                advice to the family office and who identifies 
                investment opportunities to the family office, and 
                invests in such transactions on substantially the same 
                terms as the family office invests, but does not invest 
                in other funds advised by the family office, and whose 
                assets as to which the family office directly or 
                indirectly provides investment advice represent, in the 
                aggregate, not more than 5 percent of the value of the 
                total assets as to which the family office provides 
                investment advice.

    (c) Antifraud Authority.--A family office that would not be a family 
office, but for subsection (b)(3), shall be deemed to be an investment 
adviser for the purposes of paragraphs (1), (2) and (4) of section 206 
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
