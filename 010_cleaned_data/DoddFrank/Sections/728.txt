amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(13) Public availability of swap transaction data.--
                    ``(A) Definition of real-time public reporting.--In 
                this paragraph, the term `real-time public reporting' 
                means to report data relating to a swap transaction, 
                including price and volume, as soon as technologically 
                practicable after the time at which the swap transaction 
                has been executed.
                    ``(B) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to 
                authorize the Commission to make swap transaction and 
                pricing data available to the public in such form and at 
                such times as the Commission determines appropriate to 
                enhance price discovery.
                    ``(C) General rule.--The Commission is authorized 
                and required to provide by rule for the public 
                availability of swap transaction and pricing data as 
                follows:
                          ``(i) With respect to those swaps that are 
                      subject to the mandatory clearing requirement 
                      described in subsection (h)(1) (including those 
                      swaps that are excepted from the requirement 
                      pursuant to subsection (h)(7)), the Commission 
                      shall require real-time public reporting for such 
                      transactions.
                          ``(ii) With respect to those swaps that are 
                      not subject to the mandatory clearing requirement 
                      described in subsection (h)(1), but are cleared at 
                      a registered derivatives clearing organization, 
                      the Commission shall require real-time public 
                      reporting for such transactions.
                          ``(iii) With respect to swaps that are not 
                      cleared at a registered derivatives clearing 
                      organization and which are reported to a swap data 
                      repository or the Commission under subsection 
                      (h)(6), the Commission shall require real-time 
                      public reporting for such transactions, in a 
                      manner that does not disclose the business 
                      transactions and market positions of any person.
                          ``(iv) With respect to swaps that are 
                      determined to be required to be cleared under 
                      subsection (h)(2) but are not cleared, the 
                      Commission shall require real-time public 
                      reporting for such transactions.
                    ``(D) Registered entities and public reporting.--The 
                Commission may require registered entities to publicly 
                disseminate the swap transaction and pricing data 
                required to be reported under this paragraph.
                    ``(E) Rulemaking required.--With respect to the rule

                pricing data for swaps described in clauses (i) and (ii) 
                of subparagraph (C), the rule promulgated by the 
                Commission shall contain provisions--

                      liquidity.
                    ``(F) Timeliness of reporting.--Parties to a swap 
                (including agents of the parties to a swap) shall be 
                responsible for reporting swap transaction information 
                to the appropriate registered entity in a timely manner 
                as may be prescribed by the Commission.

                repositories.--Each swap (whether cleared or uncleared) 
                shall be reported to a registered swap data repository.
