                            STANDARDS FOR NATIONAL BANKS AND 
                            SUBSIDIARIES CLARIFIED.

    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions shall apply:
            ``(1) National bank.--The term `national bank' includes--
                    ``(A) any bank organized under the laws of the 
                United States; and
                    ``(B) any Federal branch established in accordance 
                with the International Banking Act of 1978.
            ``(2) State consumer financial laws.--The term `State 
        consumer financial law' means a State law that does not directly 
        or indirectly discriminate against national banks and that


        directly and specifically regulates the manner, content, or 
        terms and conditions of any financial transaction (as may be 
        authorized for national banks to engage in), or any account 
        related thereto, with respect to a consumer.
            ``(3) Other definitions.--The terms `affiliate', 
        `subsidiary', `includes', and `including' have the same meanings 
        as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

    ``(b) Preemption Standard.--
            ``(1) In general.--State consumer financial laws are 
        preempted, only if--
                    ``(A) application of a State consumer financial law 
                would have a discriminatory effect on national banks, in 
                comparison with the effect of the law on a bank 
                chartered by that State;
                    ``(B) in accordance with the legal standard for 
                preemption in the decision of the Supreme Court of the 
                United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N. A. v. 
                Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 
                25 (1996), the State consumer financial law prevents or 
                significantly interferes with the exercise by the 
                national bank of its powers; and any preemption 
                determination under this subparagraph may be made by a 
                court, or by regulation or order of the Comptroller of 
                the Currency on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with 
                applicable law; or
                    ``(C) the State consumer financial law is preempted 
                by a provision of Federal law other than this title.
            ``(2) Savings clause.--This title and section 24 of the 
        Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371) do not preempt, annul, or 
        affect the applicability of any State law to any subsidiary or 
        affiliate of a national bank (other than a subsidiary or 
        affiliate that is chartered as a national bank).
            ``(3) Case-by-case basis.--
                    ``(A) Definition.--As used in this section the term 
                `case-by-case basis' refers to a determination pursuant 
                to this section made by the Comptroller concerning the 
                impact of a particular State consumer financial law on 
                any national bank that is subject to that law, or the 
                law of any other State with substantively equivalent 
                terms.
                    ``(B) Consultation.--When making a determination on 
                a case-by-case basis that a State consumer financial law 
                of another State has substantively equivalent terms as 
                one that the Comptroller is preempting, the Comptroller 
                shall first consult with the Bureau of Consumer 
                Financial Protection and shall take the views of the 
                Bureau into account when making the determination.
            ``(4) Rule of construction.--This title does not occupy the 
        field in any area of State law.
            ``(5) Standards of review.--
                    ``(A) Preemption.--A court reviewing any 
                determinations made by the Comptroller regarding 
                preemption of a State law by this title or section 24 of 
                the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371) shall assess the 
                validity of such determinations, depending upon the 
                thoroughness evident in the consideration of the agency, 
                the validity of the reasoning of the agency, the 
                consistency with other valid determinations made by the 
                agency, and other factors


                which the court finds persuasive and relevant to its 
                decision.
                    ``(B) Savings clause.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (A), nothing in this section shall affect 
                the deference that a court may afford to the Comptroller 
                in making determinations regarding the meaning or 
                interpretation of title LXII of the Revised Statutes of 
                the United States or other Federal laws.
            ``(6) Comptroller determination not delegable.--Any 
        regulation, order, or determination made by the Comptroller of 
        the Currency under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made by the 
        Comptroller, and shall not be delegable to another officer or 
        employee of the Comptroller of the Currency.

    ``(c) Substantial Evidence.--No regulation or order of the 
Comptroller of the Currency prescribed under subsection (b)(1)(B), shall 
be interpreted or applied so as to invalidate, or otherwise declare 
inapplicable to a national bank, the provision of the State consumer 
financial law, unless substantial evidence, made on the record of the 
proceeding, supports the specific finding regarding the preemption of 
such provision in accordance with the legal standard of the decision of 
the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County, 
N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., 517 U.S. 25 
(1996).
    ``(d) Periodic Review of Preemption Determinations.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Comptroller &lt;&lt;NOTE: Notice. Public 
        comment.&gt;&gt;  of the Currency shall periodically conduct a review, 
        through notice and public comment, of each determination that a 
        provision of Federal law preempts a State consumer financial 
        law. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  The agency shall conduct such review 
        within the 5-year period after prescribing or otherwise issuing 
        such determination, and at least once during each 5-year period 
        thereafter. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Federal Register, publication.&gt;&gt;  After 
        conducting the review of, and inspecting the comments made on, 
        the determination, the agency shall publish a notice in the 
        Federal Register announcing the decision to continue or rescind 
        the determination or a proposal to amend the determination. Any 
        such notice of a proposal to amend a determination and the 
        subsequent resolution of such proposal shall comply with the 
        procedures set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5244 
        of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 43 (a), 
        (b)).
            ``(2) Reports to congress.--At the time of issuing a review 
        conducted under paragraph (1), the Comptroller of the Currency 
        shall submit a report regarding such review to the Committee on 
        Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate. 
        The report submitted to the respective committees shall address 
        whether the agency intends to continue, rescind, or propose to 
        amend any determination that a provision of Federal law preempts 
        a State consumer financial law, and the reasons therefor.

    ``(e) Application of State Consumer Financial Law to Subsidiaries 
and Affiliates.--Notwithstanding any provision of this title or section 
24 of Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371), a State consumer financial 
law shall apply to a subsidiary or affiliate of a national bank (other 
than a subsidiary or affiliate that is chartered as a national bank) to 
the same extent that


the State consumer financial law applies to any person, corporation, or 
other entity subject to such State law.
    ``(f) Preservation of Powers Related to Charging Interest.--No 
provision of this title shall be construed as altering or otherwise 
affecting the authority conferred by section 5197 of the Revised 
Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 85) for the charging of 
interest by a national bank at the rate allowed by the laws of the 
State, territory, or district where the bank is located, including with 
respect to the meaning of `interest' under such provision.
    ``(g) Transparency of OCC Preemption Determinations.--The 
Comptroller &lt;&lt;NOTE: Publication. Deadline. Records.&gt;&gt;  of the Currency 
shall publish and update no less frequently than quarterly, a list of 
preemption determinations by the Comptroller of the Currency then in 
effect that identifies the activities and practices covered by each 
determination and the requirements and constraints determined to be 
preempted.''.

    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter one of 
title LXII of the Revised Statutes of the United States is amended by 
inserting after the item relating to section 5136B the following new 
item:

           subsidiaries clarified.''.
