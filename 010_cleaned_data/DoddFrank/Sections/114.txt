Such intermediate holding company shall be                 subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and                 to prudential standards under this title as if the                 intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial                 company supervised by the Board of Governors.                    (B) Action of the board of governors.--To facilitate                 the supervision of the financial activities subject to                 the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of                 Governors may require a company to establish an                 intermediate holding company, as provided for in section                 167, which would be subject to the supervision of the                 Board of Governors and to prudential standards under                 this title, as if the intermediate holding company were                 a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of                 Governors.            (4) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final         determination; judicial review.--         &lt;&lt;NOTE: Applicability.&gt;&gt; Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply         to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1)         in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank         financial companies.

(6) Only financial activities subject to prudential         supervision.--Nonfinancial activities of the company shall not[[Page 124 STAT. 1401]]        be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors and         prudential standards of the Board. For purposes of this Act, the         financial activities that are the subject of the determination         in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a         nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.         Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority         of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under         this title to the financial activities that are subject to the         determination in paragraph (1).
