    (a) U.S. Nonbank Financial Companies Supervised by the Board of 
Governors.--
            (1) Determination.--The Council, on a nondelegable basis and 
        by a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then 
        serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, may 
        determine that a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be 
        supervised by the Board of Governors and shall be subject to 
        prudential standards, in accordance with this title, if the 
        Council determines that material financial distress at the U.S. 
        nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, 
        concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of 
        the U.S. nonbank financial company, could pose a threat to the 
        financial stability of the United States.

                credit for low-income, minority, or underserved 
                communities, and the impact that the failure of such 
                company would have on the availability of credit in such 
                communities;
                    (F) the extent to which assets are managed rather 
                than owned by the company, and the extent to which 
                ownership of assets under management is diffuse;

                company, including the degree of reliance on short-term 
                funding; and

                deems appropriate.

Governors.--
            (1) Determination.--The Council, on a nondelegable basis and 
        by a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then 
        serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson,

                the failure of such company would have on the 
                availability of credit in such communities;

        and by a vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then 
        serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, 
        that--
                    (A) material financial distress related to, or the 
                nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, 
                interconnectedness, or mix of, the financial activities 
                conducted directly or indirectly by a company 
                incorporated or organized under the laws of the United 
                States or any State or the financial activities in the 
                United States of a company incorporated or organized in 
                a country other than the United States would


                pose a threat to the financial stability of the United 
                States, based on consideration of the factors in 
                subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2), as applicable;
                    (B) the company is organized or operates in such a 
                manner as to evade the application of this title; and
                    (C) such financial activities of the company shall 
                be supervised by the Board of Governors and subject to 
                prudential standards in accordance with this title, 
                consistent with paragraph (3).
            (2) Report.--Upon making a determination under paragraph 
        (1), the Council shall submit a report to the appropriate

        establishment of an intermediate holding company.--
                    (A) Establishment of an intermediate holding 
                company.--Upon a determination under paragraph (1), the 
                company that is the subject of the determination may 
                establish an intermediate holding company in which the 
                financial activities of such company and its 
                subsidiaries shall be conducted (other than the 
                activities described in section 167(b)(2)) in compliance 
                with any regulations or guidance provided by the Board 
                of Governors. Such intermediate holding company shall be 
                subject to the supervision of the Board of Governors and 
                to prudential standards under this title as if the 
                intermediate holding company were a nonbank financial 
                company supervised by the Board of Governors.
                    (B) Action of the board of governors.--To facilitate 
                the supervision of the financial activities subject to 
                the determination in paragraph (1), the Board of 
                Governors may require a company to establish an 
                intermediate holding company, as provided for in section 
                167, which would be subject to the supervision of the 
                Board of Governors and to prudential standards under 
                this title, as if the intermediate holding company were 
                a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of 
                Governors.
            (4) Notice and opportunity for hearing and final 
        determination; judicial review.-- 
        &lt;&lt;NOTE: Applicability.&gt;&gt; Subsections (d) through (h) shall apply 
        to determinations made by the Council pursuant to paragraph (1) 
        in the same manner as such subsections apply to nonbank 
        financial companies.
            (5) Covered financial activities.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term ``financial activities''--
                    (A) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Definition.&gt;&gt; means activities that are 
                financial in nature (as defined in section 4(k) of the 
                Bank Holding Company Act of 1956);
                    (B) includes the ownership or control of one or more 
                insured depository institutions; and
                    (C) does not include internal financial activities 
                conducted for the company or any affiliate thereof, 
                including internal treasury, investment, and employee 
                benefit functions.
            (6) Only financial activities subject to prudential 
        supervision.--Nonfinancial activities of the company shall not


        be subject to supervision by the Board of Governors and 
        prudential standards of the Board. For purposes of this Act, the 
        financial activities that are the subject of the determination 
        in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the same requirements as a 
        nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors. 
        Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or limit the authority 
        of the Board of Governors to apply prudential standards under 
        this title to the financial activities that are subject to the 
        determination in paragraph (1).

    (d) Reevaluation and Rescission.--The Council shall--
            (1) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; not less frequently than annually, 
        reevaluate each determination made under subsections (a) and (b) 
        with respect to such nonbank financial company supervised by the 
        Board of Governors; and
            (2) rescind any such determination, if the Council, by a 
        vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then serving, 
        including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, determines 
        that the nonbank financial company no longer meets the standards 
        under subsection (a) or (b), as applicable.

    (e) Notice &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadlines.&gt;&gt; and Opportunity for Hearing and 
Final Determination.--

            (2) Hearing.--Not later than 30 days after the date of

        Council to contest the proposed determination. Upon receipt of a 
        timely request, the Council shall fix a time (not later than 30

        decision of the Council.
            (4) No hearing requested.--If a nonbank financial company 
        does not make a timely request for a hearing, the Council shall

        vote of not fewer than \2/3\ of the voting members then serving, 
        including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that such 
        waiver or modification is necessary or appropriate to prevent or

        date of receipt of the request) and place at which the nonbank 
        financial company may appear, personally or through counsel, to 
        submit written materials (or, at the sole discretion of the 
        Council, oral testimony and oral argument).

States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order 
requiring that the final determination be rescinded, and the court

determination to be rescinded. Review of such an action shall be limited 
to whether the final determination made under this section was arbitrary 
and capricious.

    (i) International Coordination.--
In &lt;&lt;NOTE: Consultation.&gt;&gt; exercising its duties under this title with 
respect to foreign nonbank financial companies, foreign-based bank
