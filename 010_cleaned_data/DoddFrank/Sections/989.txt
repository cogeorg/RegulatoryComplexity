    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United 
        States shall conduct a study regarding the risks and conflicts 
        associated with proprietary trading by and within covered 
        entities, including an evaluation of--
                    (A) whether proprietary trading presents a material 
                systemic risk to the stability of the United States 
                financial system, and if so, the costs and benefits of 
                options for mitigating such systemic risk;
                    (B) whether proprietary trading presents material 
                risks to the safety and soundness of the covered 
                entities that engage in such activities, and if so, the 
                costs and benefits of options for mitigating such risks;
                    (C) whether proprietary trading presents material 
                conflicts of interest between covered entities that 
                engage in proprietary trading and the clients of the 
                institutions who use the firm to execute trades or who 
                rely on the firm to manage assets, and if so, the costs 
                and benefits of options for mitigating such conflicts of 
                interest;
                    (D) whether adequate disclosure regarding the risks 
                and conflicts of proprietary trading is provided to the 
                depositors, trading and asset management clients, and 
                investors of covered entities that engage in proprietary 
                trading, and if not, the costs and benefits of options 
                for the improvement of such disclosure; and
                    (E) whether the banking, securities, and commodities 
                regulators of institutions that engage in proprietary 
                trading have in place adequate systems and controls to 
                monitor and contain any risks and conflicts of interest 
                related to proprietary trading, and if not, the costs 
                and benefits of options for the improvement of such 
                systems and controls.
            (2) Considerations.--In carrying out the study required 
        under paragraph (1), the Comptroller General shall consider--
                    (A) current practice relating to proprietary 
                trading;
                    (B) the advisability of a complete ban on 
                proprietary trading;
                    (C) limitations on the scope of activities that 
                covered entities may engage in with respect to 
                proprietary trading;
                    (D) the advisability of additional capital 
                requirements for covered entities that engage in 
                proprietary trading;
                    (E) enhanced restrictions on transactions between 
                affiliates related to proprietary trading;
                    (F) enhanced accounting disclosures relating to 
                proprietary trading;
                    (G) enhanced public disclosure relating to 
                proprietary trading; and


                    (H) any other options the Comptroller General deems 
                appropriate.

    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 15 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
Congress on the results of the study conducted under subsection (b).
    (d) Access by Comptroller General.--For purposes of conducting the 
study required under subsection (b), the Comptroller General shall have 
access, upon request, to any information, data, schedules, books, 
accounts, financial records, reports, files, electronic communications, 
or other papers, things, or property belonging to or in use by a covered 
entity that engages in proprietary trading, and to the officers, 
directors, employees, independent public accountants, financial 
advisors, staff, and agents and representatives of a covered entity (as 
related to the activities of the agent or representative on behalf of 
the covered entity), at such reasonable times as the Comptroller General 
may request. The Comptroller General may make and retain copies of 
books, records, accounts, and other records, as the Comptroller General 
deems appropriate.

                    (A) any proprietary trading activity of a covered 
                entity, unless such information is disclosed at a level 
                of generality that does not reveal the investment or 
                trading position or strategy of the covered entity for 
                any specific security, commodity, derivative, or other 
                investment or financial product; or
                    (B) any individual interviewed by the Comptroller 
                General for purposes of the study under subsection (b), 
                unless such information is disclosed at a level of 
                generality that does not reveal--
                          (i) the name of or identifying details 
                      relating to such individual; or
                          (ii) in the case of an individual who is an 
                      employee of a third party that provides 
                      professional services to a covered entity believed 
                      to be engaged in proprietary trading, the name of 
                      or any identifying details relating to such third 
                      party.
            (2) Exceptions.--The Comptroller General may disclose the 
        information described in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) to a department, agency, or official of the 
                Federal Government, for official use, upon request;
                    (B) to a committee of Congress, upon request; and
