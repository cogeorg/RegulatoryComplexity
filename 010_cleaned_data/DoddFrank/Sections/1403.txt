                      may, by rule, waive or provide exemptions to this 
                      clause if the Board determines that such waiver or 
                      exemption is in the interest of consumers and in 
                      the public interest.

                      expensive than a loan for which the consumer 
                      qualifies, discouraging a consumer from seeking a 
                      residential mortgage loan secured by a consumer's 
                      principal dwelling from another mortgage
