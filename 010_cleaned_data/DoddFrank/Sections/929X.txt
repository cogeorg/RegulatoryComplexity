    Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) 
is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Due Diligence for the Delivery of Dividends, Interest, and 
Other Valuable Property Rights.--
            ``(1) Revision of rules required.--The Commission shall 
        revise its regulations in section 240.17Ad-17 of title 17, Code 
        of Federal Regulations, as in effect on December 8, 1997, to 
        extend the application of such section to brokers and dealers 
        and to provide for the following:
                    ``(A) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Notification. Deadline.&gt;&gt;  A 
                requirement that the paying agent provide a single 
                written notification to each missing security holder 
                that the missing security holder has been sent a check 
                that has not yet been negotiated. The written 
                notification may be sent along with a check or other 
                mailing subsequently sent to the missing security holder 
                but must be provided no later than 7 months after the 
                sending of the not yet negotiated check.
                    ``(B) An exclusion for paying agents from the 
                notification requirements when the value of the not yet 
                negotiated check is less than $25.
                    ``(C) A provision clarifying that the requirements 
                described in subparagraph (A) shall have no effect on 
                State escheatment laws.
                    ``(D) For purposes of such revised regulations--
                          ``(i) a security holder shall be considered a 
                      `missing security holder' if a check is sent to 
                      the security holder and the check is not 
                      negotiated before the earlier of the paying agent 
                      sending the next regularly scheduled check or the 
                      elapsing of 6 months after the sending of the not 
                      yet negotiated check; and
                          ``(ii) the term `paying agent' includes any 
                      issuer, transfer agent, broker, dealer, investment 
                      adviser, indenture trustee, custodian, or any 
                      other person that


                      accepts payments from the issuer of a security and 
                      distributes the payments to the holders of the 
                      security.
            ``(2) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt;  Rulemaking.--The Commission shall 
        adopt such rules, regulations, and orders necessary to implement 
        this subsection no later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
        of this subsection. In proposing such rules, the Commission 
        shall seek to minimize disruptions to current systems used by or 
        on behalf of paying agents to process payment to account holders 
        and avoid requiring multiple paying agents to send written 
        notification to a missing security holder regarding the same not 
        yet negotiated check.''.
