            ``(5) Disruptive practices.--It shall be unlawful for any 
        person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or 
        subject to the rules of a registered entity that--
                    ``(A) violates bids or offers;
                    ``(B) demonstrates intentional or reckless disregard 
                for the orderly execution of transactions during the 
                closing period; or
                    ``(C) is, is of the character of, or is commonly 
                known to the trade as, `spoofing' (bidding or offering 
                with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before 
                execution).
            ``(6) Rulemaking authority.--The Commission may make and 
        promulgate such rules and regulations as, in the judgment of the 
        Commission, are reasonably necessary to prohibit the trading 
        practices described in paragraph (5) and any other trading 
        practice that is disruptive of fair and equitable trading.
            ``(7) Use of swaps to defraud.--It shall be unlawful for any 
        person to enter into a swap knowing, or acting in reckless 
        disregard of the fact, that its counterparty will use the swap 
        as part of a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any third 
        party.''.
