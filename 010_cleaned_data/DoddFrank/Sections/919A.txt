    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study--
            (1) to identify and examine potential conflicts of interest 
        that exist between the staffs of the investment banking and 
        equity and fixed income securities analyst functions within the 
        same firm; and


            (2) to make recommendations to Congress designed to protect 
        investors in light of such conflicts.

    (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Comptroller General shall--
            (1) consider--
                    (A) the potential for investor harm resulting from 
                conflicts, including consideration of the forms of 
                misconduct engaged in by the several securities firms 
                and individuals that entered into the Global Analyst 
                Research Settlements in 2003 (also known as the ``Global 
                Settlement'');
                    (B) the nature and benefits of the undertakings to 
                which those firms agreed in enforcement proceedings, 
                including firewalls between research and investment 
                banking, separate reporting lines, dedicated legal and 
                compliance staffs, allocation of budget, physical 
                separation, compensation, employee performance 
                evaluations, coverage decisions, limitations on 
                soliciting investment banking business, disclosures, 
                transparency, and other measures;
                    (C) whether any such undertakings should be codified 
                and applied permanently to securities firms, or whether 
                the Commission should adopt rules applying any such 
                undertakings to securities firms; and
                    (D) whether to recommend regulatory or legislative 
                measures designed to mitigate possible adverse 
                consequences to investors arising from the conflicts of 
                interest or to enhance investor protection or confidence 
                in the integrity of the securities markets; and
            (2) consult with State attorneys general, State securities 
        officials, the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory 
        Authority (``FINRA''), NYSE Regulation, investor advocates, 
        brokers, dealers, retail investors, institutional investors, and 
        academics.

    (c) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report on the 
results of the study required by this section to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on 
Financial Services of the House of Representatives, not later than 18 
months after the date of enactment of this Act.
