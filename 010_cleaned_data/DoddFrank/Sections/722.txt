    (h) Determination.--The Commodity Exchange Act is amended by

``SEC. 1b. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 7 USC 1b.&gt;&gt;  REQUIREMENTS OF SECRETARY OF THE 
                      TREASURY REGARDING EXEMPTION OF FOREIGN 
                      EXCHANGE SWAPS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS 
                      FROM DEFINITION OF THE TERM `SWAP'.

    ``(a) Required Considerations.--In determining whether to exempt 
foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition 
of the term `swap', the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this 
section as the `Secretary') shall consider--
            ``(1) whether the required trading and clearing of foreign 
        exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards would create 
        systemic risk, lower transparency, or threaten the financial 
        stability of the United States;
            ``(2) whether foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange 
        forwards are already subject to a regulatory scheme that is 
        materially comparable to that established by this Act for other 
        classes of swaps;
            ``(3) the extent to which bank regulators of participants in 
        the foreign exchange market provide adequate supervision, 
        including capital and margin requirements;
            ``(4) the extent of adequate payment and settlement systems; 
        and


            ``(5) the use of a potential exemption of foreign exchange 
        swaps and foreign exchange forwards to evade otherwise 
        applicable regulatory requirements.

    ``(b) Determination.--If the Secretary makes a determination to 
exempt foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the 
definition of the term `swap', the Secretary shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a determination that contains--
            ``(1) an explanation regarding why foreign exchange swaps 
        and foreign exchange forwards are qualitatively different from 
        other classes of swaps in a way that would make the foreign 
        exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards ill-suited for 
        regulation as swaps; and
            ``(2) an identification of the objective differences of 
        foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards with 
        respect to standard swaps that warrant an exempted status.

    ``(c) Effect of Determination.--A determination by the Secretary 
under subsection (b) shall not exempt any foreign exchange swaps and 
foreign exchange forwards traded on a designated contract market or swap 
execution facility from any applicable antifraud and antimanipulation 
provision under this title.''.
