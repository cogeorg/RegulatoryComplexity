        connection with a shareholder vote described in subparagraph 
        (B), unless the beneficial owner of the security has instructed 
        the member to vote the proxy in accordance with the voting 
        instructions of the beneficial owner.
            ``(B) A shareholder vote described in this subparagraph is a
