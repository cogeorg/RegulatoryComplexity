    (a) Exemption.--Section 404 &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 7262.&gt;&gt; of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 is amended by adding at the end the following:

    ``(c) Exemption for Smaller Issuers.--Subsection (b) shall not apply 
with respect to any audit report prepared for an issuer that is neither 
a `large accelerated filer' nor an `accelerated filer' as those terms 
are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Commission (17 C.F.R. 240.12b-2).''.
    (b) Study.--The Securities and Exchange Commission shall conduct a 
study to determine how the Commission could reduce the burden of 
complying with section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for 
companies whose market capitalization is between $75,000,000 and 
$250,000,000 for the relevant reporting period while maintaining 
investor protections for such companies. The study shall also consider 
whether any such methods of reducing the compliance burden or a complete 
exemption for such companies from compliance with such section would 
encourage companies to list on exchanges in the United States in their 
initial public offerings. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline. Reports.&gt;&gt;  Not later than 9 
months after the date of the enactment of this subtitle, the Commission 
shall transmit a report of such study to Congress.
