    (a) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of--
            (1) the independence of nationally recognized statistical 
        rating organizations; and

        statistical rating organizations affects the ratings issued by 
        the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

    (b) Subjects for Evaluation.--In conducting the study under 
subsection (a), the Commission shall evaluate--

        other services, including risk management advisory services, 
        ancillary assistance, or consulting services;
            (2) the potential impact of rules prohibiting a nationally 
        recognized statistical rating organization that provides a 
        rating to an issuer from providing other services to the issuer; 
        and
            (3) any other issue relating to nationally recognized 
        statistical rating organizations, as the Chairman of the 
        Commission determines is appropriate.
