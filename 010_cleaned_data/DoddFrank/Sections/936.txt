    Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-
7), as amended by this subtitle, is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(v) Information From Sources Other Than the Issuer.--In producing 
a credit rating, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
shall consider information about an issuer that the nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization has, or receives from a 
source other than the issuer or underwriter, that the nationally 
recognized statistical rating organization finds credible and 
potentially significant to a rating decision.''.
