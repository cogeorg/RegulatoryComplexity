    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the 
United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund--
            ``(1) to evaluate, prior to consideration by the Board of 
        Executive Directors of the Fund , any proposal submitted to the 
        Board for the Fund to make a loan to a country if--
                    ``(A) the amount of the public debt of the country 
                exceeds the gross domestic product of the country as of 
                the most recent year for which such information is 
                available; and
                    ``(B) the country is not eligible for assistance 
                from the International Development Association.
            ``(2) Opposition to loans unlikely to be repaid in full.--If 
        any such evaluation indicates that the proposed loan is not 
        likely to be repaid in full, the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
        instruct the United States Executive Director at the Fund to use 
        the voice and vote of the United States to oppose the proposal.

    ``(b) Reports to Congress.--Within 30 days after the Board of 
Executive Directors of the Fund approves a proposal described in 
subsection (a), and annually thereafter by June 30, for the


duration of any program approved under such proposals, the Secretary of 
the Treasury shall report in writing to the Committee on Financial 
Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign 
Relations and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
the Senate assessing the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such 
proposals will be repaid in full, including--
            ``(1) the borrowing country's current debt status, 
        including, to the extent possible, its maturity structure, 
        whether it has fixed or floating rates, whether it is indexed, 
        and by whom it is held;
            ``(2) the borrowing country's external and internal 
        vulnerabilities that could potentially affect its ability to 
        repay; and
            ``(3) the borrowing country's debt management strategy.''.
