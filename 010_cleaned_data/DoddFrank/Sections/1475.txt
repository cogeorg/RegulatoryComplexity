    Subsection (e) of section 701 of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1691) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(e) Copies Furnished to Applicants.--
            ``(1) In general.-- &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline.&gt;&gt; Each creditor shall 
        furnish to an applicant a copy of any and all written appraisals 
        and valuations developed in connection with the applicant's 
        application for a loan that is secured or would have been 
        secured by a first lien on a dwelling promptly upon completion, 
        but in no case later than 3 days prior to the closing of the 
        loan, whether the creditor grants or denies the applicant's 
        request for credit or the application is incomplete or 
        withdrawn.


            ``(2) Waiver.--The applicant may waive the 3 day requirement 
        provided for in paragraph (1), except where otherwise required 
        in law.
            ``(3) Reimbursement.--The applicant may be required to pay a 
        reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the 
        appraisal, except where otherwise required in law.
            ``(4) Free copy.--Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the 
        creditor shall provide a copy of each written appraisal or 
        valuation at no additional cost to the applicant.
            ``(5) Notification to applicants.--At the time of 
        application, the creditor shall notify an applicant in writing 
        of the right to receive a copy of each written appraisal and 
        valuation under this subsection.
            ``(6) Valuation defined.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        the term `valuation' shall include any estimate of the value of 
        a dwelling developed in connection with a creditor's decision to 
        provide credit, including those values developed pursuant to a 
        policy of a government sponsored enterprise or by an automated 
        valuation model, a broker price opinion, or other methodology or 
        mechanism.''.
