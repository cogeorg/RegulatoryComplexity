                        WARRANTIES IN ASSET-BACKED OFFERINGS.

    Not &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadline. Regulations.&gt;&gt; later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
shall prescribe regulations on the use of representations and warranties 
in the market for asset-backed securities (as that term is defined in 
section 3(a)(77) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by 
this subtitle) that--
            (1) require each national recognized statistical rating 
        organization to include in any report accompanying a credit 
        rating a description of--
                    (A) the representations, warranties, and enforcement 
                mechanisms available to investors; and
                    (B) how they differ from the representations, 
                warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of 
                similar securities; and
            (2) require any securitizer (as that term is defined in 
        section 15G(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added 
        by this subtitle) to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled 
        repurchase requests across all trusts aggregated by the 
        securitizer, so that investors may identify asset originators 
        with clear underwriting deficiencies.
