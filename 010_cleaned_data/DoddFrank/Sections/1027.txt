                          THE BUREAU; PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITIES.

    (a) Exclusion for Merchants, Retailers, and Other Sellers of 
Nonfinancial Goods or Services.--
            (1) Sale or brokerage of nonfinancial good or service.--The 
        Bureau may not exercise any rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement 
        or other authority under this title with respect to a person who 
        is a merchant, retailer, or seller of any nonfinancial good or 
        service and is engaged in the sale or brokerage of such 
        nonfinancial good or service, except to the extent that such 
        person is engaged in offering or providing any consumer 
        financial product or service, or is otherwise subject to any 
        enumerated consumer law or any law for which authorities are 
        transferred under subtitle F or H.
            (2) Offering or provision of certain consumer financial 
        products or services in connection with the sale or brokerage of 
        nonfinancial good or service.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), and subject to subparagraph (C), the Bureau may not 
                exercise any rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, or 
                other authority under this title with respect to a 
                merchant, retailer, or seller of nonfinancial goods or 
                services, but only to the extent that such person--
                          (i) extends credit directly to a consumer, in 
                      a case in which the good or service being provided 
                      is not itself a consumer financial product or 
                      service (other than credit described in this 
                      subparagraph), exclusively for the purpose of 
                      enabling that consumer to purchase such 
                      nonfinancial good or service directly from the 
                      merchant, retailer, or seller;
                          (ii) directly, or through an agreement with 
                      another person, collects debt arising from credit 
                      extended as described in clause (i); or
                          (iii) sells or conveys debt described in 
                      clause (i) that is delinquent or otherwise in 
                      default.
                    (B) Applicability.--Subparagraph (A) does not apply 
                to any credit transaction or collection of debt, other 
                than as described in subparagraph (C)(i), arising from a 
                transaction described in subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) in which the merchant, retailer, or seller 
                      of nonfinancial goods or services assigns, sells 
                      or otherwise conveys to another person such debt 
                      owed by the consumer (except for a sale of debt 
                      that is delinquent or otherwise in default, as 
                      described in subparagraph (A)(iii));
                          (ii) in which the credit extended 
                      significantly exceeds the market value of the 
                      nonfinancial good or service provided, or the 
                      Bureau otherwise finds that the sale of the 
                      nonfinancial good or service is done as a 
                      subterfuge, so as to evade or circumvent the 
                      provisions of this title; or


                          (iii) in which the merchant, retailer, or 
                      seller of nonfinancial goods or services regularly 
                      extends credit and the credit is subject to a 
                      finance charge.
                    (C) Limitations.--
                          (i) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Applicability.&gt;&gt;  In general.--
                      Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), subparagraph (A) 
                      shall apply with respect to a merchant, retailer, 
                      or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that 
                      is not engaged significantly in offering or

                          (ii) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) and clause 
                      (i) of this subparagraph do not apply to any 
                      merchant, retailer, or seller of nonfinancial 
                      goods or services--
                                    (I) if such merchant, retailer, or 
                                seller of nonfinancial goods or services 
                                is engaged in a transaction described in 
                                subparagraph (B)(i) or (B)(ii); or
                                    (II) to the extent that such 
                                merchant, retailer, or seller is subject 
                                to any enumerated consumer law or any 
                                law for which authorities are 
                                transferred under subtitle F or H, but 
                                the Bureau may exercise such authority 
                                only with respect to that law.
                    (D) Rules.--
                          (i) Authority of other agencies.--No provision 
                      of this title shall be construed as modifying, 
                      limiting, or superseding the supervisory or 
                      enforcement authority of the Federal Trade 
                      Commission or any other agency (other than the 
                      Bureau) with respect to credit extended, or the 
                      collection of debt arising from such extension, 
                      directly by a merchant or retailer to a consumer 
                      exclusively for the purpose of enabling that 
                      consumer to purchase nonfinancial goods or 
                      services directly from the merchant or retailer.
                          (ii) Small businesses.--A merchant, retailer, 
                      or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that 
                      would otherwise be subject to the authority of the 
                      Bureau solely by virtue of the application of 
                      subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be deemed not to be 
                      engaged significantly in offering or providing 
                      consumer financial products or services under 
                      subparagraph (C)(i), if such person--
                                    (I) only extends credit for the sale 
                                of nonfinancial goods or services, as 
                                described in subparagraph (A)(i);
                                    (II) retains such credit on its own 
                                accounts (except to sell or convey such 
                                debt that is delinquent or otherwise in 
                                default); and

                                size threshold to be a small business 
                                concern, based on annual receipts, 
                                pursuant to section 3 of the Small 
                                Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and the 
                                implementing rules thereunder.
                          (iii) Initial year.--A merchant, retailer, or 
                      seller of nonfinancial goods or services shall be 
                      deemed to meet the relevant industry size 
                      threshold described in clause (ii)(III) during the 
                      first year of operations of that business concern 
                      if, during that year, the


                      receipts of that business concern reasonably are 
                      expected to meet that size threshold.
                          (iv) Other standards for small business.--With 
                      respect to a merchant, retailer, or seller of 
                      nonfinancial goods or services that is a 
                      classified on a basis other than annual receipts

                      Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and the implementing 
                      rules thereunder, such merchant, retailer, or 
                      seller shall be deemed to meet the relevant 
                      industry size threshold described in clause 
                      (ii)(III) if such merchant, retailer, or seller 
                      meets the relevant industry size threshold to be a 
                      small business concern based on the number of 
                      employees, or other such applicable measure, 
                      established under that Act.
                    (E) Exception from state enforcement.--To the extent 
                that the Bureau may not exercise authority under this 
                subsection with respect to a merchant, retailer, or

                    (B) Not a customary and usual accounting activity.--
                For purposes of this subsection, extending or brokering

                paragraph (1)(A) shall not be deemed to be extending 
                credit, if such person is only extending credit directly
