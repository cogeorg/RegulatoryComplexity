section, the term ``retail customer'' means a natural person, or the 
legal representative of such natural person, who--
            (1) receives personalized investment advice about securities 
        from a broker or dealer or investment adviser; and
            (2) uses such advice primarily for personal, family, or 
        household purposes.

    (b) &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78o note.&gt;&gt;  Study.--The Commission shall conduct 
a study to evaluate--
            (1) the effectiveness of existing legal or regulatory 
        standards of care for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, 
        persons associated with brokers or dealers, and persons 
        associated with investment advisers for providing personalized 
        investment advice and recommendations about securities to retail 
        customers imposed by the Commission and a national securities 
        association, and other Federal and State legal or regulatory 
        standards; and
            (2) whether there are legal or regulatory gaps, 
        shortcomings, or overlaps in legal or regulatory standards in 
        the protection of retail customers relating to the standards of 
        care


        for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons associated 
        with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with investment 
        advisers for providing personalized investment advice about 
        securities to retail customers that should be addressed by rule 
        or statute.

    (c) &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78o note.&gt;&gt;  Considerations.--In conducting the

        standards of care for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, 
        persons associated with brokers or dealers, and persons 
        associated with investment advisers for providing personalized 
        investment advice and recommendations about securities to retail 
        customers imposed by the Commission and a national securities 
        association, and other Federal and State legal or regulatory 
        standards;
            (2) whether there are legal or regulatory gaps,

        care for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons 
        associated with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with

        about securities to retail customers that should be addressed by 
        rule or statute;
            (3) whether retail customers understand that there are 
        different standards of care applicable to brokers, dealers, 
        investment advisers, persons associated with brokers or dealers, 
        and persons associated with investment advisers in the provision 
        of personalized investment advice about securities to retail 
        customers;

        applicable to brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons 
        associated with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with 
        investment advisers is a source of confusion for retail 
        customers regarding the quality of personalized investment 
        advice that retail customers receive;
            (5) the regulatory, examination, and enforcement resources 
        devoted to, and activities of, the Commission, the States, and a

        for brokers, dealers, investment advisers, persons associated 
        with brokers or dealers, and persons associated with investment 
        advisers when providing personalized investment advice and 
        recommendations about securities to retail customers,

                    (C) the length of time of the examinations;
            (6) the substantive differences in the regulation of 
        brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, when providing 
        personalized investment advice and recommendations about 
        securities to retail customers;

        personalized investment advice about securities in which--
                    (A) the regulation and oversight of investment 
                advisers provide greater protection to retail customers 
                than the regulation and oversight of brokers and 
                dealers; and


                    (B) the regulation and oversight of brokers and 
                dealers provide greater protection to retail customers 
                than the regulation and oversight of investment 
                advisers;

                Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et

                securities to retail customers of investment advisers, 
                as interpreted by the Commission and the courts; and
                    (B) other requirements of the Investment Advisers

            (1) Securities exchange act of 1934.--Section 15 of the

    ``(k) Standard of Conduct.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this Act or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commission 
        may promulgate rules to provide that, with respect to a broker 
        or dealer, when providing personalized investment advice about 
        securities to a retail customer (and such other customers as the 
        Commission may by rule provide), the standard of conduct for 
        such broker or dealer with respect to such customer shall be the 
        same as the standard of conduct applicable to an investment 
        adviser under section 211 of the Investment Advisers Act of 
        1940. The receipt of compensation based on commission or other 
        standard compensation for the sale of securities shall not, in 
        and of itself, be considered a violation of such standard 
        applied to a broker or dealer. Nothing in this section shall 
        require a broker or dealer or registered representative to have 
        a continuing duty of care or loyalty to the customer after 
        providing personalized investment advice about securities.
            ``(2) Disclosure of range of products offered.--Where a 
        broker or dealer sells only proprietary or other limited range 
        of products, as determined by the Commission, the Commission may 
        by rule require that such broker or dealer provide notice to 
        each retail customer and obtain the consent or acknowledgment of 
        the customer. The sale of only proprietary or other limited 
        range of products by a broker or dealer shall not, in and of 
        itself, be considered a violation of the standard set forth in 
        paragraph (1).

    ``(l) Other Matters.--The Commission shall--
            ``(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear 
        disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their 
        relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, 
        including any material conflicts of interest; and
            ``(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules 
        prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of 
        interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and 
        investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the 
        public interest and the protection of investors.''.
            (2) Investment advisers act of 1940.--Section 211 of the 
        Investment Advisers Act of 1940, &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 80b-11.&gt;&gt;  is 
        further amended by adding at the end the following new 
        subsections:

    ``(g) Standard of Conduct.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Commission may promulgate rules to 
        provide that the standard of conduct for all brokers, dealers, 
        and investment advisers, when providing personalized investment 
        advice about securities to retail customers (and such other 
        customers as the Commission may by rule provide), shall be to 
        act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the 
        financial or other interest of the broker, dealer, or investment 
        adviser providing the advice. In accordance with such


        rules, any material conflicts of interest shall be disclosed and 
        may be consented to by the customer. Such rules shall provide 
        that such standard of conduct shall be no less stringent than 
        the standard applicable to investment advisers under section 
        206(1) and (2) of this Act when providing personalized 
        investment advice about securities, except the Commission shall 
        not ascribe a meaning to the term `customer' that would include 
        an investor in a private fund managed by an investment adviser, 
        where such private fund has entered into an advisory contract 
        with such adviser. The receipt of compensation based on 
        commission or fees shall not, in and of itself, be considered a 
        violation of such standard applied to a broker, dealer, or 
        investment adviser.
            ``(2) Retail customer defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `retail customer' means a natural person, 
        or the legal representative of such natural person, who--
                    ``(A) receives personalized investment advice about 
                securities from a broker, dealer, or investment adviser; 
                and
                    ``(B) uses such advice primarily for personal, 
                family, or household purposes.

    ``(h) Other Matters.--The Commission shall--
            ``(1) facilitate the provision of simple and clear 
        disclosures to investors regarding the terms of their 
        relationships with brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, 
        including any material conflicts of interest; and
            ``(2) examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules 
        prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of 
        interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and 
        investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the 
        public interest and the protection of investors.''.

            (1) Securities exchange act of 1934.--Section 15 of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, &lt;&lt;NOTE: 15 USC 78o.&gt;&gt;  as 
        amended by subsection (g)(1), is further amended by adding at 
        the end the following new subsection:

the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct 
applicable to a broker or dealer providing personalized investment 
advice about securities to a retail customer shall include--
            ``(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to such violations provided under this Act; and

        respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to 
        an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 
        including the authority to impose sanctions for such violations, 
        and

the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of the 
standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing 
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer 
under this Act to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and sanctions 
violators of the standard of conduct applicable to an investment advisor 
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.''.
            (2) Investment advisers act of 1940.--Section 211 of the 
        Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended by subsection


        (g)(2), is further amended by adding at the end the following 
        new subsection:

    ``(i) Harmonization of Enforcement.--The enforcement authority of 
the Commission with respect to violations of the standard of conduct 
applicable to an investment adviser shall include--
            ``(1) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to such violations provided under this Act; and
            ``(2) the enforcement authority of the Commission with 
        respect to violations of the standard of conduct applicable to a 
        broker or dealer providing personalized investment advice about 
        securities to a retail customer under the Securities Exchange 
        Act of 1934, including the authority to impose sanctions for 
        such violations, and

the Commission shall seek to prosecute and sanction violators of the 
standard of conduct applicable to an investment adviser under this Act 
to same extent as the Commission prosecutes and sanctions violators of 
the standard of conduct applicable to a broker or dealer providing 
personalized investment advice about securities to a retail customer 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.''.
