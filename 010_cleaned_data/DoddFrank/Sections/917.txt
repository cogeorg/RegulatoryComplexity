            (3) the most useful and understandable relevant information 
        that retail investors need to make informed financial decisions 
        before engaging a financial intermediary or purchasing an

        investors, including shares of open-end companies, as that term

        described in paragraph (3);
            (5) the most effective existing private and public efforts 
        to educate investors; and
            (6) in consultation with the Financial Literacy and 
        Education Commission, a strategy (including, to the extent 
        practicable, measurable goals and objectives) to increase the 
        financial literacy of investors in order to bring about a 
        positive change in investor behavior.
