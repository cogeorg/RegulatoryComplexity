    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this title that was 
added by the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, or 
any rule or regulation thereunder, shall apply to any person insofar as 
such person transacts a business in security-based swaps without the 
jurisdiction of the United States, unless such person transacts such 
business in contravention of such rules and regulations as the 
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the 
evasion of any provision of this title that was added by the Wall Street 
Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. This subsection shall not 
be construed to limit the jurisdiction of the Commission under any 
provision of this title, as in effect prior to the date of enactment of 
the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010.''.
