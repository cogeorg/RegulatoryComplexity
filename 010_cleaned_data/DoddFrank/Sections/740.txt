    Section 22(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 25(a)) is 
amended by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:
    ``(4) Contract Enforcement Between Eligible Counterparties.--
            ``(A) In general.--No hybrid instrument sold to any investor 
        shall be void, voidable, or unenforceable, and no party to a 
        hybrid instrument shall be entitled to rescind, or recover any 
        payment made with respect to, the hybrid instrument under this 
        section or any other provision of Federal or State law, based 
        solely on the failure of the hybrid instrument to comply with 
        the terms or conditions of section 2(f) or regulations of the 
        Commission.
            ``(B) Swaps.--No agreement, contract, or transaction between 
        eligible contract participants or persons reasonably believed to 
        be eligible contract participants shall be void, voidable, or 
        unenforceable, and no party to such agreement, contract, or 
        transaction shall be entitled to rescind, or recover any payment 
        made with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction 
        under this section or any other provision of Federal or State 
        law, based solely on the failure of the agreement, contract, or 
        transaction--
                    ``(i) to meet the definition of a swap under section 
                1a; or
                    ``(ii) to be cleared in accordance with section 
                2(h)(1).

    ``(5) Legal Certainty for Long-term Swaps Entered Into Before the 
Date of Enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act 
of 2010.--
            ``(A) Effect on swaps.--Unless specifically reserved in the 
        applicable swap, neither the enactment of the Wall Street 
        Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, nor any requirement 
        under that Act or an amendment made by that Act, shall 
        constitute a termination event, force majeure, illegality, 
        increased costs, regulatory change, or similar event under a 
        swap (including any related credit support arrangement) that 
        would permit a party to terminate, renegotiate, modify, amend, 
        or supplement 1 or more transactions under the swap.
            ``(B) Position limits.--Any position limit established under 
        the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 
        shall not apply to a position acquired in good faith prior to 
        the effective date of any rule, regulation, or order under the 
        Act that establishes the position limit; provided, however, that 
        such positions shall be attributed to the trader if the trader's 
        position is increased after the effective date of such position 
        limit rule, regulation, or order.''.
