    (a) Report Required.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
shall conduct a study to determine the effects the enactment of this Act 
will have on the availability and affordability of credit for consumers, 
small businesses, homebuyers, and mortgage lending, including the 
effect--
            (1) on the mortgage market for mortgages that are not within 
        the safe harbor provided in the amendments made by this 
        subtitle;
            (2) on the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain 
        financing;
            (3) on the ability of homeowners facing resets or 
        adjustments to refinance--for example, do they have fewer 
        refinancing options due to the unavailability of certain loan 
        products that were available before the enactment of this Act;
            (4) on minorities' ability to access affordable credit 
        compared with other prospective borrowers;
            (5) on home sales and construction;
            (6) of extending the rescission right, if any, on adjustable 
        rate loans and its impact on litigation;
            (7) of State foreclosure laws and, if any, an investor's 
        ability to transfer a property after foreclosure;
            (8) of expanding the existing provisions of the Home 
        Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994;
            (9) of prohibiting prepayment penalties on high-cost 
        mortgages; and
            (10) of establishing counseling services under the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development and offered through 
        the Office of Housing Counseling.

    (b) Report.--Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit 
a report to the Congress containing the findings and conclusions of the 
Comptroller General with respect to the study conducted pursuant to 
subsection (a).
    (c) Examination Related to Certain Credit Risk Retention 
Provisions.--The report required by subsection (b) shall also


include an analysis by the Comptroller General of the effect on the 
capital reserves and funding of lenders of credit risk retention 
provisions for non-qualified mortgages, including an analysis of the 
exceptions and adjustments authorized in section 129C(b)(3) of the Truth 
in Lending Act and a recommendation on whether a uniform standard is 
needed.
    (d) Analysis of Credit Risk Retention Provisions.--The report 
required by subsection (b) shall also include--
            (1) an analysis by the Comptroller General of whether the 
        credit risk retention provisions have significantly reduced 
        risks to the larger credit market of the repackaging and selling 
        of securitized loans on a secondary market; and
            (2) recommendations to the Congress on adjustments that 
        should be made, or additional measures that should be 
        undertaken.
