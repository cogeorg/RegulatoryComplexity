                with respect to a significant price discovery 
                contract,'' and inserting ``swaps traded on or subject 
                to the rules of a


                designated contract market or a swap execution facility,

                designated contract market or a swap execution facility 
                that performs a significant price discovery function 
                with respect to a registered entity,''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:

                general.--In accordance with the standards set forth in 
                paragraph (1) of this subsection and consistent with the 
                good faith exception cited in subsection (b)(2), with 
                respect to physical commodities other than excluded 
                commodities as defined by the Commission, the Commission 
                shall by rule, regulation, or order establish limits on 
                the amount of positions, as appropriate, other than bona 
                fide hedge positions, that may be held by any person 
                with respect to contracts of sale for future delivery or

                ensure that trading on foreign boards of trade in the 
                same commodity will be subject to comparable limits and 
                that any limits to be imposed by the Commission will not 
                cause price discovery in the commodity to shift to 
                trading on the foreign boards of trade.
            ``(3) Specific limitations.--In establishing the limits 
        required in paragraph (2), the Commission, as appropriate, shall

                      excessive speculation as described under this

            ``(4) Significant price discovery function.--In making a 
        determination whether a swap performs or affects a significant 
        price discovery function with respect to regulated markets, the 
        Commission shall consider, as appropriate:


                    ``(A) Price linkage.--The extent to which the swap 
                uses or otherwise relies on a daily or final settlement 
                price, or other major price parameter, of another 
                contract traded on a regulated market based upon the 
                same underlying commodity, to value a position, transfer 
                or convert a position, financially settle a position, or 
                close out a position.
                    ``(B) Arbitrage.--The extent to which the price for 
                the swap is sufficiently related to the price of another 
                contract traded on a regulated market based upon the 
                same underlying commodity so as to permit market 
                participants to effectively arbitrage between the 
                markets by simultaneously maintaining positions or 
                executing trades in the swaps on a frequent and 
                recurring basis.
                    ``(C) Material price reference.--The extent to 
                which, on a frequent and recurring basis, bids, offers, 
                or transactions in a contract traded on a regulated 
                market are directly based on, or are determined by 
                referencing, the price generated by the swap.
                    ``(D) Material liquidity.--The extent to which the 
                volume of swaps being traded in the commodity is 
                sufficient to have a material effect on another contract 
                traded on a regulated market.
                    ``(E) Other material factors.--Such other material 
                factors as the Commission specifies by rule or 
                regulation as relevant to determine whether a swap 
                serves a significant price discovery function with 
                respect to a regulated market.
            ``(5) Economically equivalent contracts.--
                    ``(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
                section, the Commission shall establish limits on the 
                amount of positions, including aggregate position 
                limits, as appropriate, other than bona fide hedge 
                positions, that may be held by any person with respect 
                to swaps that are economically equivalent to contracts 
                of sale for future delivery or to options on the 
                contracts or commodities traded on or subject to the 
                rules of a designated contract market subject to

        or class of persons, any swap or class of swaps, any contract of 
        sale of a commodity for future delivery or class of such 
        contracts, any option or class of options, or any transaction or 
        class of transactions from any requirement it may establish 
        under this section with respect to position limits.''.

Act (7 U.S.C. 6a(b)) is amended--

        trading facility'' and inserting ``or swap execution facility or 
        facilities''; and

        transaction execution facility or facilities or electronic 
        trading facility'' and inserting ``or swap execution facility''.

Exchange Act is amended--
