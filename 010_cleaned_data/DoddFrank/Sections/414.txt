                        INVESTOR STANDARD.

    (a) In General.--The Commission shall adjust any net worth standard 
for an accredited investor, as set forth in the rules of the Commission 
under the Securities Act of 1933, so that the individual net worth of 
any natural person, or joint net worth with the spouse of that person, 
at the time of purchase, is more than $1,000,000 (as such amount is 
adjusted periodically by rule of the Commission), excluding the value of 
the primary residence of such natural person, except that during the 4-
year period that begins on the date of enactment of this Act, any net 
worth standard shall be $1,000,000, excluding the value of the primary 
residence of such natural person.
    (b) Review and Adjustment.--
            (1) Initial review and adjustment.--
                    (A) Initial review.--The Commission may undertake a 
                review of the definition of the term ``accredited 
                investor'', as such term applies to natural persons, to 
                determine whether the requirements of the definition, 
                excluding the requirement relating to the net worth 
                standard described in subsection (a), should be adjusted 
                or modified for the


                protection of investors, in the public interest, and in 
                light of the economy.
                    (B) Adjustment or modification.--Upon completion of 
                a review under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, by 
                notice and comment rulemaking, make such adjustments to 
                the definition of the term ``accredited investor'', 
                excluding adjusting or modifying the requirement 
                relating to the net worth standard described in 
                subsection (a), as such term applies to natural persons, 
                as the Commission may deem appropriate for the 
                protection of investors, in the public interest, and in 
                light of the economy.
            (2) Subsequent reviews and adjustment.--
                    (A) Subsequent reviews. &lt;&lt;NOTE: Deadlines.&gt;&gt; --Not 
                earlier than 4 years after the date of enactment of this 
                Act, and not less frequently than once every 4 years 
                thereafter, the Commission shall undertake a review of 
                the definition, in its entirety, of the term 
                ``accredited investor'', as defined in section 230.215 
                of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any 
                successor thereto, as such term applies to natural 
                persons, to determine whether the requirements of the 
                definition should be adjusted or modified for the 
                protection of investors, in the public interest, and in 
                light of the economy.
                    (B) Adjustment or modification.--Upon completion of 
                a review under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, by 
                notice and comment rulemaking, make such adjustments to 
                the definition of the term ``accredited investor'', as 
                defined in section 230.215 of title 17, Code of Federal 
                Regulations, or any successor thereto, as such term 
                applies to natural persons, as the Commission may deem 
                appropriate for the protection of investors, in the 
                public interest, and in light of the economy.
