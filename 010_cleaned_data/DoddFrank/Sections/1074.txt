            (1) In general.--The Secretary &lt;&lt;NOTE: Recommenda- tions.&gt;&gt;  
        of the Treasury shall conduct a study of and develop 
        recommendations regarding the options for ending the 
        conservatorship of the Federal National Mortgage Association (in 
        this section referred to as ``Fannie Mae'') and the Federal Home 
        Loan Mortgage Corporation (in this section referred to as 
        ``Freddie Mac''), while minimizing the cost to taxpayers, 
        including such options as--
                    (A) the gradual wind-down and liquidation of such 
                entities;
                    (B) the privatization of such entities;
                    (C) the incorporation of the functions of such 
                entities into a Federal agency;
                    (D) the dissolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
                into smaller companies; or
                    (E) any other measures the Secretary determines 
                appropriate.
            (2) Analyses.--The study required under paragraph (1) shall 
        include an analysis of--
                    (A) the role of the Federal Government in supporting 
                a stable, well-functioning housing finance system, and 
                whether and to what extent the Federal Government should 
                bear risks in meeting Federal housing finance 
                objectives;
                    (B) how the current structure of the housing finance 
                system can be improved;
                    (C) how the housing finance system should support 
                the continued availability of mortgage credit to all 
                segments of the market;
                    (D) how the housing finance system should be 
                structured to ensure that consumers continue to have 
                access to 30-year, fixed rate, pre-payable mortgages and 
                other mortgage products that have simple terms that can 
                be easily understood;
                    (E) the role of the Federal Housing Administration 
                and the Department of Veterans Affairs in a future 
                housing system;
                    (F) the impact of reforms of the housing finance 
                system on the financing of rental housing;
                    (G) the impact of reforms of the housing finance 
                system on secondary market liquidity;
                    (H) the role of standardization in the housing 
                finance system;
                    (I) how housing finance systems in other countries 
                offer insights that can help inform options for reform 
                in the United States; and
                    (J) the options for transition to a reformed housing 
                finance system.
