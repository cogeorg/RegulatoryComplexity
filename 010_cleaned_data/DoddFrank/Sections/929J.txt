    ``(b) Production of Documents.--
            ``(1) Production by foreign firms.--If a foreign public

        work, or conducts interim reviews, the foreign public accounting 
        firm shall--

                the Commission or the Board, upon request of the

                of the United States for purposes of enforcement of any 
                request for such documents.
            ``(2) Other production.--Any registered public accounting 
        firm that relies, in whole or in part, on the work of a foreign 
        public accounting firm in issuing an audit report, performing

                to any such work in response to a request for production 
                by the Commission or the Board; and
                    ``(B) secure the agreement of any foreign public 
                accounting firm to such production, as a condition of 
                the reliance by the registered public accounting firm on 
                the work of that foreign public accounting firm.'';
            (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (g); and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:

    ``(d) Service of Requests or Process.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any foreign public accounting firm that 
        performs work for a domestic registered public accounting firm 
        shall furnish to the domestic registered public accounting firm

        designates the domestic registered public accounting firm as an 
        agent upon whom may be served any request by the Commission or 
        the Board under this section or upon whom may be served any 
        process, pleadings, or other papers in any action brought to 
        enforce this section.


            ``(2) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Designation.&gt;&gt;  Specific audit work.--Any

        performs audit work, or, performs interim reviews, shall 
        designate to the Commission or the Board an agent in the United 
        States upon whom may be served any request by the Commission or 
        the Board under this section or upon whom may be served any 
        process, pleading, or other papers in any action brought to 
        enforce this section.

    ``(e) Sanctions.--A willful refusal to comply, in whole in or in 
part, with any request by the Commission or the Board under this 
section, shall be deemed a violation of this Act.
    ``(f) Other Means of Satisfying Production Obligations.--
