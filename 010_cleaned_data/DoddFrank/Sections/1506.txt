    (a) Study.--The Corporation shall conduct a study to evaluate--
            (1) the definition of core deposits for the purpose of 
        calculating the insurance premiums of banks;
            (2) the potential impact on the Deposit Insurance Fund of 
        revising the definitions of brokered deposits and core deposits 
        to better distinguish between them;
            (3) an assessment of the differences between core deposits 
        and brokered deposits and their role in the economy and banking 
        sector of the United States;
            (4) the potential stimulative effect on local economies of 
        redefining core deposits; and
            (5) the competitive parity between large institutions and 
        community banks that could result from redefining core deposits.

    (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Corporation shall submit to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on 
Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report on the 
results of the study under subsection (a) that includes legislative 
recommendations, if any, to address concerns arising in connection with 
the definitions of core deposits and brokered deposits.
