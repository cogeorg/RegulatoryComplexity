    (a) Study Required.--The Council shall conduct a study evaluating 
the importance of maximizing United States taxpayer protections and 
promoting market discipline with respect to the treatment of fully 
secured creditors in the utilization of the orderly liquidation 
authority authorized by this Act. In carrying out such study, the 
Council shall--
            (1) not be prejudicial to current or past laws or 
        regulations with respect to secured creditor treatment in a 
        resolution process;
            (2) study the similarities and differences between the 
        resolution mechanisms authorized by the Bankruptcy Code, the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, 
        and the orderly liquidation authority authorized by this Act;
            (3) determine how various secured creditors are treated in 
        such resolution mechanisms and examine how a haircut (of various 
        degrees) on secured creditors could improve market discipline 
        and protect taxpayers;
            (4) compare the benefits and dynamics of prudent lending 
        practices by depository institutions in secured loans for 
        consumers and small businesses to the lending practices of 
        secured creditors to large, interconnected financial firms;
            (5) consider whether credit differs according to different 
        types of collateral and different terms and timing of the 
        extension of credit; amd
            (6) include an examination of stakeholders who were 
        unsecured or under-collateralized and seek collateral when a 
        firm is failing, and the impact that such behavior has on 
        financial stability and an orderly resolution that protects 
        taxpayers if the firm fails.

    (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 1-year period beginning 
on the date of enactment of this Act, the Council shall issue a report 
to the Congress containing all findings and conclusions


made by the Council in carrying out the study required under subsection 
(a).
