    Section 4d of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6d) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (e); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:

    ``(c) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Procedures.&gt;&gt;  Conflicts of Interest.--The Commission 
shall require that futures commission merchants and introducing brokers 
implement conflict-of-interest systems and procedures that--
            ``(1) establish structural and institutional safeguards to 
        ensure that the activities of any person within the firm 
        relating to research or analysis of the price or market for any 
        commodity are separated by appropriate informational partitions 
        within the firm from the review, pressure, or oversight of 
        persons whose involvement in trading or clearing activities 
        might potentially bias the judgment or supervision of the 
        persons; and
            ``(2) address such other issues as the Commission determines 
        to be appropriate.

    ``(d) &lt;&lt;NOTE: Regulations.&gt;&gt;  Designation of Chief Compliance 
Officer.--Each futures commission merchant shall designate an individual 
to serve as its Chief Compliance Officer and perform such duties and 
responsibilities as shall be set forth in regulations to be adopted by 
the Commission or rules to be adopted by a futures association 
registered under section 17.''.
