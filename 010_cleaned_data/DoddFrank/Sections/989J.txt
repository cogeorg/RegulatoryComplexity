    (a) Study Regarding Exemption for Smaller Issuers.--The Comptroller 
General of the United States shall carry out a study


on the impact of the amendments made by this Act to section 404(b) of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262(b)), which shall include 
an analysis of--
            (1) whether issuers that are exempt from such section 404(b) 
        have fewer or more restatements of published accounting 
        statements than issuers that are required to comply with such 
        section 404(b);
            (2) the cost of capital for issuers that are exempt from 
        such section 404(b) compared to the cost of capital for issuers 
        that are required to comply with such section 404(b);
            (3) whether there is any difference in the confidence of 
        investors in the integrity of financial statements of issuers 
        that comply with such section 404(b) and issuers that are exempt 
        from compliance with such section 404(b);
            (4) whether issuers that do not receive the attestation for 
        internal controls required under such section 404(b) should be 
        required to disclose the lack of such attestation to investors; 
        and
            (5) the costs and benefits to issuers that are exempt from 
        such section 404(b) that voluntarily have obtained the 
        attestation of an independent auditor.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on 
Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report on the 
results of the study required under subsection (a).
