</div> <div class="paragraph"> 1. This document, together with the document Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, presents the Basel Committee's<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity rules with the goal of promoting a more resilient banking sector. The objective of the reforms is to improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. This document sets out the rules text and timelines to implement the Basel III framework.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 2. The Committee's comprehensive reform package addresses the lessons of the financial crisis. Through its reform package, the Committee also aims to improve risk management and governance as well as strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures. <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> Moreover, the reform package includes the Committee's efforts to strengthen the resolution of systemically significant cross-border banks. <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></div> <div class="paragraph"> 3. A strong and resilient banking system is the foundation for sustainable economic growth, as banks are at the centre of the credit intermediation process between savers and investors. Moreover, banks provide critical services to consumers, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporate firms and governments who rely on them to conduct their daily business, both at a domestic and international level.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 4. One of the main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007, became so severe was that the banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive onand off-balance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual erosion of the level and quality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks were holding insufficient liquidity buffers. The banking system therefore was not able to absorb the resulting systemic trading and credit losses nor could it cope with the reintermediation of large off-balance sheet exposures that had built up in the shadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified by a procyclical deleveraging process and by the interconnectedness of systemic institutions through an array of complex transactions. During the most severe episode of the crisis, the market lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The weaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial system and the real economy, resulting in a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability. Ultimately the public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of liquidity, capital support and guarantees, exposing taxpayers to large losses.</div> <div class= "foot" id="ref1"> 1 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consists of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. It usually meets at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, where its permanent Secretariat is located.</div> <div class="foot" id="ref2"> 2 In July 2009, the Committee introduced a package of measures to strengthen the 1996 rules governing trading book capital and to enhance the three pillars of the Basel II framework. See Enhancements to the Basel II framework (July 2009), available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs157.htm.</div> <div class="foot" id="ref3"> 3 These efforts include the Basel Committee's recommendations to strengthen national resolution powers and their cross-border implementation. The Basel Committee mandated its Cross-border Bank Resolution Group to report on the lessons from the crisis, on recent changes and adaptations of national frameworks for crossborder resolutions, the most effective elements of current national frameworks and those features of current national frameworks that may hamper optimal responses to crises. See Report and recommendations of the Cross-border Bank Resolution Group (March 2010), available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs169.htm.</div> <div class="new_page"></div></div> <div class="paragraph"> 5. The effect on banks, financial systems and economies at the epicentre of the crisis was immediate. However, the crisis also spread to a wider circle of countries around the globe. For these countries the transmission channels were less direct, resulting from a severe contraction in global liquidity, cross-border credit availability and demand for exports. Given the scope and speed with which the recent and previous crises have been transmitted around the globe as well as the unpredictable nature of future crises, it is critical that all countries raise the resilience of their banking sectors to both internal and external shocks.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 6. To address the market failures revealed by the crisis, the Committee is introducing a number of fundamental reforms to the international regulatory framework. The reforms strengthen bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of individual banking institutions to periods of stress. The reforms also have a macroprudential focus, addressing system-wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as the procyclical amplification of these risks over time. Clearly these micro and macroprudential approaches to supervision are interrelated, as greater resilience at the individual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks.</div> <div class="head_2"> A. Strengthening the global capital framework</div> <div class="paragraph"> 7. The Basel Committee is raising the resilience of the banking sector by strengthening the regulatory capital framework, building on the three pillars of the Basel II framework. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. They are underpinned by a leverage ratio that serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital measures, is intended to constrain excess leverage in the banking system and provide an extra layer of protection against model risk and measurement error. Finally, the Committee is introducing a number of macroprudential elements into the capital framework to help contain systemic risks arising from procyclicality and from the interconnectedness of financial institutions.</div> <div class="head_3"> 1. Raising the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base</div> <div class="paragraph"> 8. It is critical that banks' risk exposures are backed by a high quality capital base. The crisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings, which is part of banks' tangible common equity base. It also revealed the inconsistency in the definition of capital across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled the market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital between institutions.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 9. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and retained earnings. This standard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be tailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold comparable levels of high quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been harmonised internationally and generally applied at the level of common equity or its equivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainder of the Tier 1 capital base must be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary noncumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to redeem. Innovative hybrid capital instruments with an incentive to redeem through features such as step-up clauses, currently limited to 15% of the Tier 1 capital base, will be phased out. In addition, Tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonised and so-called Tier 3 capital instruments, which were only available to cover market risks, eliminated. Finally, to improve market discipline, the transparency of the capital base will be improved, with all elements of capital required to be disclosed along with a detailed reconciliation to the reported accounts.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 10. The Committee is introducing these changes in a manner that minimises the disruption to capital instruments that are currently outstanding. It also continues to review the role that contingent capital should play in the regulatory capital framework.</div> <div class="head_3"> 2. Enhancing risk coverage</div> <div class="paragraph"> 11. One of the key lessons of the crisis has been the need to strengthen the risk coverage of the capital framework. Failure to capture major on- and off-balance sheet risks, as well as derivative related exposures, was a key destabilising factor during the crisis.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 12. In response to these shortcomings, the Committee in July 2009 completed a number of critical reforms to the Basel II framework. These reforms will raise capital requirements for the trading book and complex securitisation exposures, a major source of losses for many internationally active banks. The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk (VaR) capital requirement based on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress. In addition, the Committee has introduced higher capital requirements for so-called resecuritisations in both the banking and the trading book. The reforms also raise the standards of the Pillar 2 supervisory review process and strengthen Pillar 3 disclosures. The Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 enhancements must be implemented by the end of 2011; the Pillar 2 standards became effective when they were introduced in July 2009. The Committee is also conducting a fundamental review of the trading book. The work on the fundamental review of the trading book is targeted for completion by year-end 2011.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 13. This document also introduces measures to strengthen the capital requirements for counterparty credit exposures arising from banks' derivatives, repo and securities financing activities. These reforms will raise the capital buffers backing these exposures, reduce procyclicality and provide additional incentives to move OTC derivative contracts to central counterparties, thus helping reduce systemic risk across the financial system. They also provide incentives to strengthen the risk management of counterparty credit exposures.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 14. To this end, the Committee is introducing the following reforms:</div> <div class="bs7"> (a) Going forward, banks must determine their capital requirement for counterparty credit risk using stressed inputs. This will address concerns about capital charges becoming too low during periods of compressed market volatility and help address procyclicality. The approach, which is similar to what has been introduced for market risk, will also promote more integrated management of market and counterparty credit risk.</div> <div class="bs7"> (b) Banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses (ie credit valuation adjustment - CVA - risk) associated with a deterioration in the credit worthiness of a counterparty. While the Basel II standard covers the risk of a counterparty default, it does not address such CVA risk, which during the financial crisis was a greater source of losses than those arising from outright defaults.</div> <div class="bs7"> (c) The Committee is strengthening standards for collateral management and initial margining. Banks with large and illiquid derivative exposures to a counterparty will have to apply longer margining periods as a basis for determining the regulatory capital requirement. Additional standards have been adopted to strengthen collateral risk management practices.</div> <div class="bs7"> (d) To address the systemic risk arising from the interconnectedness of banks and other financial institutions through the derivatives markets, the Committee is supporting the efforts of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to establish strong standards for financial market infrastructures, including central counterparties. The capitalisation of bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) will be based in part on the compliance of the CCP with such standards, and will be finalised after a consultative process in 2011. A bank's collateral and mark-to-market exposures to CCPs meeting these enhanced principles will be subject to a low risk weight, proposed at 2%; and default fund exposures to CCPs will be subject to risk-sensitive capital requirements. These criteria, together with strengthened capital requirements for bilateral OTC derivative exposures, will create strong incentives for banks to move exposures to such CCPs. Moreover, to address systemic risk within the financial sector, the Committee also is raising the risk weights on exposures to financial institutions relative to the non-financial corporate sector, as financial exposures are more highly correlated than non-financial ones.</div> <div class="bs7"> (e) The Committee is raising counterparty credit risk management standards in a number of areas, including for the treatment of so-called wrong-way risk, ie cases where the exposure increases when the credit quality of the counterparty deteriorates. It also issued final additional guidance for the sound backtesting of counterparty credit exposures.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 15. Finally, the Committee assessed a number of measures to mitigate the reliance on external ratings of the Basel II framework. The measures include requirements for banks to perform their own internal assessments of externally rated securitisation exposures, the elimination of certain "cliff effects" associated with credit risk mitigation practices, and the incorporation of key elements of the IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies into the Committee's eligibility criteria for the use of external ratings in the capital framework. The Committee also is conducting a more fundamental review of the securitisation framework, including its reliance on external ratings.</div> <div class="head_3"> 3. Supplementing the risk-based capital requirement with a leverage ratio</div> <div class="paragraph"> 16. One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build up of excessive on- and off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. The build up of leverage also has been a feature of previous financial crises, for example leading up to September 1998. During the most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating the positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and the contraction in credit availability. The Committee therefore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement that is intended to achieve the following objectives:</div> <div class="bullet">  constrain leverage in the banking sector, thus helping to mitigate the risk of the destabilising deleveraging processes which can damage the financial system and the economy; and</div> <div class="bullet">  introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by supplementing the risk-based measure with a simple, transparent, independent measure of risk.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 17. The leverage ratio is calculated in a comparable manner across jurisdictions, adjusting for any differences in accounting standards. The Committee has designed the leverage ratio to be a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based requirement with a view to migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment based on appropriate review and calibration.</div> <div class="head_3"> 4. Reducing procyclicality and promoting countercyclical buffers</div> <div class="paragraph"> 18. One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis has been the procyclical amplification of financial shocks throughout the banking system, financial markets and the broader economy. The tendency of market participants to behave in a procyclical manner has been amplified through a variety of channels, including through accounting standards for both mark-to-market assets and held-to-maturity loans, margining practices, and through the build up and release of leverage among financial institutions, firms, and consumers. The Basel Committee is introducing a number of measures to make banks more resilient to such procyclical dynamics. These measures will help ensure that the banking sector serves as a shock absorber, instead of a transmitter of risk to the financial system and broader economy.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 19. In addition to the leverage ratio discussed in the previous section, the Committee is introducing a series of measures to address procyclicality and raise the resilience of the banking sector in good times. These measures have the following key objectives:</div> <div class="bullet">  dampen any excess cyclicality of the minimum capital requirement;</div> <div class="bullet">  promote more forward looking provisions;</div> <div class="bullet">  conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and the banking sector that can be used in stress; and</div> <div class="bullet">  achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the banking sector from periods of excess credit growth.</div> <div class="head"> Cyclicality of the minimum requirement</div> <div class="paragraph"> 20. The Basel II framework increased the risk sensitivity and coverage of the regulatory capital requirement. Indeed, one of the most procyclical dynamics has been the failure of risk management and capital frameworks to capture key exposures - such as complex trading activities, resecuritisations and exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles - in advance of the crisis. However, it is not possible to achieve greater risk sensitivity across institutions at a given point in time without introducing a certain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital requirements over time. The Committee was aware of this trade-off during the design of the Basel II framework and introduced a number of safeguards to address excess cyclicality of the minimum requirement. They include the requirement to use long term data horizons to estimate probabilities of default, the introduction of so called downturn loss-given-default (LGD) estimates and the appropriate calibration of the risk functions, which convert loss estimates into regulatory capital requirements. The Committee also required that banks conduct stress tests that consider the downward migration of their credit portfolios in a recession.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 21. In addition, the Committee has put in place a comprehensive data collection initiative to assess the impact of the Basel II framework on its member countries over the credit cycle. Should the cyclicality of the minimum requirement be greater than supervisors consider appropriate, the Committee will consider additional measures to dampen such cyclicality.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 22. The Committee has reviewed a number of additional measures that supervisors could take to achieve a better balance between risk sensitivity and the stability of capital requirements, should this be viewed as necessary. In particular, the range of possible measures includes an approach by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) to use the Pillar 2 process to adjust for the compression of probability of default (PD) estimates in internal ratings-based (IRB) capital requirements during benign credit conditions by using the PD estimates for a bank's portfolios in downturn conditions. <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> Addressing the same issue, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) has proposed an approach aimed at providing non-cyclical PDs in IRB requirements through the application of a scalar that converts the outputs of a bank's underlying PD models into through-the-cycle estimates. <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></div> <div class="head"> Forward looking provisioning</div> <div class="paragraph"> 23. The Committee is promoting stronger provisioning practices through three related initiatives. First, it is advocating a change in the accounting standards towards an expected loss (EL) approach. The Committee strongly supports the initiative of the IASB to move to an EL approach. The goal is to improve the usefulness and relevance of financial reporting for stakeholders, including prudential regulators. It has issued publicly and made available to the IASB a set of high level guiding principles that should govern the reforms to the replacement of IAS 39. <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> The Committee supports an EL approach that captures actual losses more transparently and is also less procyclical than the current "incurred loss" approach.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 24. Second, it is updating its supervisory guidance to be consistent with the move to such an EL approach. Such guidance will assist supervisors in promoting strong provisioning practices under the desired EL approach.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 25. Third, it is addressing incentives to stronger provisioning in the regulatory capital framework.</div> <div class="head"> Capital conservation</div> <div class="paragraph"> 26. The Committee is introducing a framework to promote the conservation of capital and the build-up of adequate buffers above the minimum that can be drawn down in periods of stress.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 27. At the onset of the financial crisis, a number of banks continued to make large distributions in the form of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation payments even though their individual financial condition and the outlook for the sector were deteriorating. Much of this activity was driven by a collective action problem, where reductions in distributions were perceived as sending a signal of weakness. However, these actions made individual banks and the sector as a whole less resilient. Many banks soon returned to profitability but did not do enough to rebuild their capital buffers to support new lending activity. Taken together, this dynamic has increased the procyclicality of the system.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 28. To address this market failure, the Committee is introducing a framework that will give supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector. Implementation of the framework through internationally agreed capital conservation standards will help increase sector resilience going into a downturn and will provide the mechanism for rebuilding capital during the economic recovery. Moreover, the framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for a range of supervisory and bank responses consistent with the standard.</div> <div class= "foot" id="ref4"> 4 See CEBS Position paper on a countercyclical capital buffer (July 2009), available at www.c-ebs.org/getdoc/715bc0f9-7af9-47d9-98a8-778a4d20a880/CEBS-position-paper-on-a-countercyclicalcapital-b.aspx.</div> <div class="foot" id="ref5"> 5 See UK FSA's note Variable Scalar Approaches to Estimating Through the cycle PDs (February 2009), available at www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/international/variable_scalars.pdf.</div> <div class="foot" id="ref6"> 6 See Guiding principles for the revision of accounting standards for financial instruments issued by the Basel Committee (August 2009), available at www.bis.org/press/p090827.htm.</div> <div class="new_page"></div> </div> <div class="head"> Excess credit growth</div> <div class="paragraph"> 29. As witnessed during the financial crisis, losses incurred in the banking sector during a downturn preceded by a period of excess credit growth can be extremely large. Such losses can destabilise the banking sector, which can bring about or exacerbate a downturn in the real economy. This in turn can further destabilise the banking sector. These interlinkages highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up its capital defences in periods when credit has grown to excessive levels. The building up of these defences should have the additional benefit of helping to moderate excess credit growth.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 30. The Basel Committee is introducing a regime which will adjust the capital buffer range, established through the capital conservation mechanism outlined in the previous section, when there are signs that credit has grown to excessive levels. The purpose of the countercyclical buffer is to achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the banking sector in periods of excess aggregate credit growth.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 31. The measures to address procyclicality are designed to complement each other. The initiatives on provisioning focus on strengthening the banking system against expected losses, while the capital measures focus on unexpected losses. Among the capital measures, there is a distinction between addressing the cyclicality of the minimum and building additional buffers above that minimum. Indeed, strong capital buffers above the minimum requirement have proven to be critical, even in the absence of a cyclical minimum. Finally, the requirement to address excess credit growth is set at zero in normal times and only increases during periods of excessive credit availability. However, even in the absence of a credit bubble, supervisors expect the banking sector to build a buffer above the minimum to protect it against plausibly severe shocks, which could emanate from many sources.</div> <div class="head_3"> 5. Addressing systemic risk and interconnectedness</div> <div class="paragraph"> 32. While procyclicality amplified shocks over the time dimension, excessive interconnectedness among systemically important banks also transmitted shocks across the financial system and economy. Systemically important banks should have loss absorbing capacity beyond the minimum standards and the work on this issue is ongoing. The Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board are developing a well integrated approach to systemically important financial institutions which could include combinations of capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt. As part of this effort, the Committee is developing a proposal on a methodology comprising both quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess the systemic importance of financial institutions at a global level. The Committee is also conducting a study of the magnitude of additional loss absorbency that globally systemic financial institutions should have, along with an assessment of the extent of going concern loss absorbency which could be provided by the various proposed instruments. The Committee's analysis has also covered further measures to mitigate the risks or externalities associated with systemic banks, including liquidity surcharges, tighter large exposure restrictions and enhanced supervision. It will continue its work on these issues in the first half of 2011 in accordance with the processes and timelines set out in the FSB recommendations.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 33. Several of the capital requirements introduced by the Committee to mitigate the risks arising from firm-level exposures among global financial institutions will also help to address systemic risk and interconnectedness. These include:</div> <div class="bullet">  capital incentives for banks to use central counterparties for over-the-counter derivatives;</div> <div class="bullet">  higher capital requirements for trading and derivative activities, as well as complex securitisations and off-balance sheet exposures (eg structured investment vehicles);</div> <div class="bullet">  higher capital requirements for inter-financial sector exposures; and</div> <div class="bullet">  the introduction of liquidity requirements that penalise excessive reliance on short term, interbank funding to support longer dated assets.</div> <div class="head_2"> B. Introducing a global liquidity standard</div> <div class="paragraph"> 34. Strong capital requirements are a necessary condition for banking sector stability but by themselves are not sufficient. A strong liquidity base reinforced through robust supervisory standards is of equal importance. To date, however, there have been no internationally harmonised standards in this area. The Basel Committee is therefore introducing internationally harmonised global liquidity standards. As with the global capital standards, the liquidity standards will establish minimum requirements and will promote an international level playing field to help prevent a competitive race to the bottom.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 35. During the early "liquidity phase" of the financial crisis, many banks - despite adequate capital levels - still experienced difficulties because they did not manage their liquidity in a prudent manner. The crisis again drove home the importance of liquidity to the proper functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. Prior to the crisis, asset markets were buoyant and funding was readily available at low cost. The rapid reversal in market conditions illustrated how quickly liquidity can evaporate and that illiquidity can last for an extended period of time. The banking system came under severe stress, which necessitated central bank action to support both the functioning of money markets and, in some cases, individual institutions.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 36. The difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basic principles of liquidity risk management. In response, as the foundation of its liquidity framework, the Committee in 2008 published Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision. <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> The Sound Principles provide detailed guidance on the risk management and supervision of funding liquidity risk and should help promote better risk management in this critical area, but only if there is full implementation by banks and supervisors. As such, the Committee will coordinate rigorous follow up by supervisors to ensure that banks adhere to these fundamental principles.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 37. To complement these principles, the Committee has further strengthened its liquidity framework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity. An additional component of the liquidity framework is a set of monitoring metrics to improve cross-border supervisory consistency.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 38. These standards have been developed to achieve two separate but complementary objectives. The first objective is to promote short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for one month. The Committee developed the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to achieve this objective. The second objective is to promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating additional incentives for a bank to fund its activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing structural basis. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.</div> <div class= "foot" id="ref7"> 7 Available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs144.htm.</div> <div class="new_page"></div> </div> <div class="paragraph"> 39. These two standards are comprised mainly of specific parameters which are internationally "harmonised" with prescribed values. Certain parameters contain elements of national discretion to reflect jurisdiction-specific conditions. In these cases, the parameters should be transparent and clearly outlined in the regulations of each jurisdiction to provide clarity both within the jurisdiction and internationally.</div> <div class="head_2"> 1. Liquidity Coverage Ratio</div> <div class="paragraph"> 40. The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liquidity disruptions over a thirty day horizon. It will help ensure that global banks have sufficient unencumbered, highquality liquid assets to offset the net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute shortterm stress scenario. The specified scenario is built upon circumstances experienced in the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and entails both institution-specific and systemic shocks. The scenario entails a significant stress, albeit not a worst-case scenario, and assumes the following:</div> <div class="bullet">  a significant downgrade of the institution's public credit rating;</div> <div class="bullet">  a partial loss of deposits;</div> <div class="bullet">  a loss of unsecured wholesale funding;</div> <div class="bullet">  a significant increase in secured funding haircuts; and</div> <div class="bullet">  increases in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and noncontractual off-balance sheet exposures, including committed credit and liquidity facilities.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 41. High-quality liquid assets held in the stock should be unencumbered, liquid in markets during a time of stress and, ideally, be central bank eligible.</div> <div class="head_2"> 2. Net Stable Funding Ratio</div> <div class="paragraph"> 42. The NSFR requires a minimum amount of stable sources of funding at a bank relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity needs arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon. The NSFR aims to limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding during times of buoyant market liquidity and encourage better assessment of liquidity risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items.</div> <div class="head_2"> 3. Monitoring tools</div> <div class="paragraph"> 43. At present, supervisors use a wide range of quantitative measures to monitor the liquidity risk profiles of banking organisations as well as across the financial sector, for a macroprudential approach to supervision. A survey of Basel Committee members conducted in early 2009 identified that more than 25 different measures and concepts are used globally by supervisors. To introduce more consistency internationally, the Committee has developed a set of common metrics that should be considered as the minimum types of information which supervisors should use. In addition, supervisors may use additional metrics in order to capture specific risks in their jurisdictions. The monitoring metrics include the following and may evolve further as the Committee conducts further work. One area in particular where more work on monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk.</div> <div class="bs7"> (a) Contractual maturity mismatch: To gain an understanding of the basic aspects of a bank's liquidity needs, banks should frequently conduct a contractual maturity mismatch assessment. This metric provides an initial, simple baseline of contractual commitments and is useful in comparing liquidity risk profiles across institutions, and to highlight to both banks and supervisors when potential liquidity needs could arise.</div> <div class="bs7"> (b) Concentration of funding: This metric involves analysing concentrations of wholesale funding provided by specific counterparties, instruments and currencies. A metric covering concentrations of wholesale funding assists supervisors in assessing the extent to which funding liquidity risks could occur in the event that one or more of the funding sources are withdrawn.</div> <div class="bs7"> (c) Available unencumbered assets: This metric measures the amount of unencumbered assets a bank has which could potentially be used as collateral for secured funding either in the market or at standing central bank facilities. This should make banks (and supervisors) more aware of their potential capacity to raise additional secured funds, keeping in mind that in a stressed situation this ability may decrease.</div> <div class="bs7"> (d) LCR by currency: In recognition that foreign exchange risk is a component of liquidity risk, the LCR should also be assessed in each significant currency, in order to monitor and manage the overall level and trend of currency exposure at a bank.</div> <div class="bs7"> (e) Market-related monitoring tools: In order to have a source of instantaneous data on potential liquidity difficulties, useful data to monitor includes market-wide data on asset prices and liquidity, institution-related information such as credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices, and additional institution-specific information related to the ability of the institution to fund itself in various wholesale funding markets and the price at which it can do so.</div> <div class="head_2"> C. Transitional arrangements</div> <div class="paragraph"> 44. The Committee is introducing transitional arrangements to implement the new standards that help ensure that the banking sector can meet the higher capital standards through reasonable earnings retention and capital raising, while still supporting lending to the economy. The transitional arrangements are described in the Basel III liquidity rules text document and summarised in Annex 4 of this document.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 45. After an observation period beginning in 2011, the LCR will be introduced on 1 January 2015. The NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018. The Committee will put in place rigorous reporting processes to monitor the ratios during the transition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial markets, credit extension and economic growth, addressing unintended consequences as necessary.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 46. Both the LCR and the NSFR will be subject to an observation period and will include a review clause to address any unintended consequences.</div> <div class="head_2"> D. Scope of application</div> <div class="paragraph"> 47.

The global banking system entered the crisis with an insufficient level of high quality capital. The crisis also revealed the inconsistency in the definition of capital across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled the market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital across jurisdictions. A key element of the new definition of capital is the greater focus on common equity, the highest quality component of a bank's capital.</div> <div class="head_2"> I.

An instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the issuing bank to make a dividend/coupon payment on the instrument if it has made a payment on another (typically more junior) capital instrument or share. This obligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full discretion at all times. Furthermore, the term "cancel distributions/payments" means extinguish these payments.

Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability of the bank to be realised are to be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. Deferred tax assets may be netted with associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) only if the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by the relevant taxation authority. Where these DTAs relate to temporary differences (eg allowance for credit losses) the amount to be deducted is set out in the "threshold deductions" section below. All other such assets, eg those relating to operating losses, such as the carry forward of unused tax losses, or unused tax credits, are to be deducted in full net of deferred tax liabilities as described above. The DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets, and must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to the threshold deduction treatment and DTAs that are to be deducted in full.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 70. An overinstallment of tax or, in some jurisdictions, current year tax losses carried back to prior years may give rise to a claim or receivable from the government or local tax authority. Such amounts are typically classified as current tax assets for accounting purposes. The recovery of such a claim or receivable would not rely on the future profitability of the bank and would be assigned the relevant sovereign risk weighting.</div> <div class="head"> Cash flow hedge reserve</div> <div class="paragraph"> 71. The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve that relates to the hedging of items that are not fair valued on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be derecognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts should be deducted and negative amounts should be added back.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 72. This treatment specifically identifies the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that is to be derecognised for prudential purposes. It removes the element that gives rise to artificial volatility in common equity, as in this case the reserve only reflects one half of the picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not the changes in fair value of the hedged future cash flow).</div> <div class="head"> Shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses</div> <div class="paragraph"> 73. The deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses under the IRB approach should be made in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and should not be reduced by any tax effects that could be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses.</div> <div class="head"> Gain on sale related to securitisation transactions</div> <div class="paragraph"> 74.

Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be fully recognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 (ie Common Equity Tier 1 cannot be increased through derecognising these liabilities). For each defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. Assets in the fund to which the bank has unrestricted and unfettered access can, with supervisory approval, offset the deduction. Such offsetting assets should be given the risk weight they would receive if they were owned directly by the bank.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 77. This treatment addresses the concern that assets arising from pension funds may not be capable of being withdrawn and used for the protection of depositors and other creditors of a bank. The concern is that their only value stems from a reduction in future payments into the fund. The treatment allows for banks to reduce the deduction of the asset if they can address these concerns and show that the assets can be easily and promptly withdrawn from the fund.</div> <div class="head"> Investments in own shares (treasury stock)</div> <div class="paragraph"> 78. All of a bank's investments in its own common shares, whether held directly or indirectly, will be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 (unless already derecognised under the relevant accounting standards). In addition, any own stock which the bank could be contractually obliged to purchase should be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. The treatment described will apply irrespective of the location of the exposure in the banking book or the trading book. In addition:</div> <div class="bullet">  Gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions in the same underlying exposure only if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.</div> <div class="bullet">  Banks should look through holdings of index securities to deduct exposures to own shares. However, gross long positions in own shares resulting from holdings of index securities may be netted against short position in own shares resulting from short positions in the same underlying index. In such cases the short positions may involve counterparty risk (which will be subject to the relevant counterparty credit risk charge).</div> <div clas="head">  This deduction is necessary to avoid the double counting of a bank's own capital. Certain accounting regimes do not permit the recognition of treasury stock and so this deduction is only relevant where recognition on the balance sheet is permitted. The treatment seeks to remove the double counting that arises from direct holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares. </div> <div class="paragraph"> Following the same approach outlined above, banks must deduct investments in their own Additional Tier 1 in the calculation of their Additional Tier 1 capital and must deduct investments in their own Tier 2 in the calculation of their Tier 2 capital.

Reciprocal cross holdings of capital that are designed to artificially inflate the capital position of banks will be deducted in full.

To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk as defined in paragraph 105, banks must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital charge (not including the CVA charge in paragraphs 97-104) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio-level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress calibration should be a single consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should not be applied on a counterparty by counterparty basis, but on a total portfolio level.</div> <div class="paragraph"> 61. When the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the bank must employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of historical data must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied data may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, the bank must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of a bank's counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration: 30</div> <div class="bullet">  The bank must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads - such as loan or corporate bond spreads - for a representative selection of the bank's counterparties with traded credit spreads.

The exposure to these benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) current positions at current market prices, stressed volatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure model inputs from the 3-year stress period and (b) current positions at end of stress period market prices, stressed volatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure model inputs from the 3-year stress period.

In addition to the default risk capital requirements for counterparty credit risk determined based on the standardised or internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches for credit risk, a bank must add a capital charge to cover the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value adjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will be calculated in the manner set forth below depending on the bank's approved method of calculating capital charges for counterparty credit risk and specific interest rate risk. A bank is not required to include in this capital charge (i) transactions with a central counterparty (CCP); and (ii) securities financing transactions (SFT), unless their supervisor determines that the bank's CVA loss exposures arising from SFT transactions are material.</div> <div class="head_2"> A.

Banks with IMM approval for counterparty credit risk and approval to use the market risk internal models approach for the specific interest-rate risk of bonds must calculate this additional capital charge by modelling the impact of changes in the counterparties' credit spreads on the CVAs of all OTC derivative counterparties, together with eligible CVA hedges according to new paragraphs 102 and 103, using the bank's VaR model for bonds. This VaR model is restricted to changes in the counterparties' credit spreads and does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes in other market factors, such as changes in the value of the reference asset, commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative. Regardless of the accounting valuation method a bank uses for determining CVA, the CVA capital charge calculation must be based on the following formula for the CVA of each counterparty:

    <p>$$CVA = {LGD_{mkt}} \sum_{i=1}^T Max\left(0; exp \frac{-S_{i-1}t_{i-1}}{LGD_{MKT}}- exp \frac{-S_{i-1}t_{i}}{LGD_{MKT}} \right) \left(\frac{EE_{i-1}D_{i-1}+ EE_i D_i}{2} \right) $$</p>

Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately rated. A bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the treatment of individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities. Those policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way risk for each legal entity to which the bank is exposed. Transactions with counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 58, Annex 4).</div> <div class="paragraph"> 29. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of alpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong way risk - see paragraph 58):</div> <div class="paragraph"> 58. A bank is exposed to "specific wrong-way risk" if future exposure to a specific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty's probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrongway exposures for the buyer that is specific to the counterparty. A bank must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of specific wrong way risk, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single-name credit default swaps where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where specific wrong way risk has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the bank to recognise, in respect of such swap, the market value that has been lost already and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or Foundation IRB banks must be set to 100% for such swap transactions. <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup> For banks using the Standardised Approach, the risk weight to use is</div> <div class= "foot" id="ref41"> 41 Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap.

For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where specific wrong way risk has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this makes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC) that already contain an LGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%.</div> <div class="head_3"> 2.

In order to implement the increased margin periods of risk, the following new paragraphs 41(i) and 41 (ii) will be inserted into Annex 4 of the Basel II framework: 41(i). For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market valuation, a supervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements.

For these purposes, "Illiquid collateral" and "OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced" must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be characterised by the absence of continuously active markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not limited to, trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific accounting treatment for valuation purposes (eg OTC derivatives or repostyle transactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).</div> <div class="bullet">  In addition, a bank must consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the bank would be able to replace its trades. 41 (ii). If a bank has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular netting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the bank must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters. 41 (iii). For re-margining with a periodicity of N-days, irrespective of the shortcut method or full IMM model, the margin period of risk should be at least equal to the supervisory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day.

For other transactions eligible for the VaR models approach, the 10-business day holding period will be retained. The minimum holding period should be adjusted upwards for market instruments where such a holding period would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the instrument concerned. At a minimum, where a bank has a repo-style or similar transaction or netting set which meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs 41(i) or 41 (ii) of Annex 4, the minimum holding period should be the margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with paragraph 41(iii).</div> <div class="head"> Revise the shortcut method for estimating Effective EPE</div> <div class="paragraph"> 104.

Shortcut method: a bank that can model EPE without margin agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modelling sophistication to model EPE with margin agreements can use the following method for margined counterparties subject to re-margining and daily mark-to-market as described in paragraph 41 (i). <sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup> The method is a simple approximation to Effective EPE and sets Effective EPE for a margined counterparty equal to the lesser of: a) Effective EPE without any held or posted margining collateral, plus any collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily valuation and margining process or current exposure (ie initial margin or independent amount); or b) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure over the margin period of risk plus the larger of i. the current exposure net of and including all collateral currently held or posted, excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or ii. the largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. This amount should reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts, independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement. The add-on is calculated as E[max(ΔMtM, 0)], where E[…] is the expectation (ie the average over scenarios) and ΔMtM is the possible change of the mark-to-market value of the transactions during the margin period of risk. Changes in the value of collateral need to be reflected using the supervisory haircut method or the internal estimates method, but no collateral payments are assumed during the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk is subject to the supervisory floor specified in paragraphs 41(i) to 41(iii). Backtesting should test whether realised (current) exposures are consistent with the shortcut method prediction over all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk factor sensitivities without these trades, this fact should be taken into account. If backtesting indicates that effective EPE is underestimated, the bank should take actions to make the method more conservative, eg by scaling up risk factor moves.</div> <div class="head"> Preclude downgrade triggers from being reflected in EAD</div> <div class="paragraph"> 105. In order to explicitly disallow downgrade triggers in EAD, a new paragraph 41(iv) will be inserted into Annex 4 to read as follows: 41(iv). Banks using the internal models method must not capture the effect of a reduction of EAD due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.</div> <div class="head"> Add requirements to improve the operational performance of the collateral department</div> <div class="paragraph"> 106. To implement the requirements designed to improve the collateral department operations, two new paragraphs, 51(i) and 51(ii), will be incorporated into Annex 4 and</div> <div class= "foot" id="ref44"> 44 42 Where a bank generally uses this shortcut method to measure Effective EPE, this shortcut method may be used by a bank that is a clearing member in a CCP for its transactions with the CCP and with clients, including those client transactions that result in back-to-back trades with a CCP.</div> <div class="new_page"></div> paragraph 777(x), Part 3: The Second Pillar - Supervisory Review Process, will be revised as follows: 51(i). Banks applying the internal model method must have a collateral management unit that is responsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data within the bank. This unit must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash) and the rights that the bank gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it posts. These internal reports must indicate the categories of collateral assets that are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted by the banks. Senior management must allocate sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the bank to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. 51(ii). The bank's collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate collateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of collateral (both cash and non-cash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes. This internal reporting should also reflect trends in these figures. 777(x). The bank must conduct an independent review of the CCR management system regularly through its own internal auditing process. This review must include both the activities of the business credit and trading units and of the independent CCR control unit. A review of the overall CCR management process must take place at regular intervals (ideally not less than once a year) and must specifically address, at a minimum:</div> <div class="bullet">  the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR management system and process;</div>
